        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this third
        part of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        Golden Bough</span></span> we take up the question, Why had the King
        of the Wood at Nemi regularly to perish by the hand of his successor?
        In the first part of the work I gave some reasons for thinking that
        the priest of Diana, who bore the title of King of the Wood beside
        the still lake among the Alban Hills, personated the great god
        Jupiter or his duplicate Dianus, the deity of the oak, the thunder,
        and the sky. On this theory, accordingly, we are at once confronted
        with the wider and deeper question, Why put a man-god or human
        representative of deity to a violent death? Why extinguish the divine
        light in its earthly vessel instead of husbanding it to its natural
        close? My general answer to that question is contained in the present
        volume. If I am right, the motive for slaying a man-god is a fear
        lest with the enfeeblement of his body in sickness or old age his
        sacred spirit should suffer a corresponding decay, which might
        imperil the general course of nature and with it the existence of his
        worshippers, who believe the cosmic energies to be mysteriously knit
        up with those of their human divinity. Hence, if there is any measure
        of truth in this theory, the practice of putting divine men and
        particularly divine kings to death, which seems to have been common
        at a particular stage in the evolution of society and religion, was a
        crude but pathetic attempt to disengage an immortal spirit from its
        mortal envelope, to arrest the forces of decomposition in nature by
        retrenching <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg
        vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with
        ruthless hand the first ominous symptoms of decay. We may smile if we
        please at the vanity of these and the like efforts to stay the
        inevitable decline, to bring the relentless revolution of the great
        wheel to a stand, to keep youth's fleeting roses for ever fresh and
        fair; but perhaps in spite of every disillusionment, when we
        contemplate the seemingly endless vistas of knowledge which have been
        opened up even within our own generation, many of us may cherish in
        our heart of hearts a fancy, if not a hope, that some loophole of
        escape may after all be discovered from the iron walls of the
        prison-house which threaten to close on and crush us; that, groping
        about in the darkness, mankind may yet chance to lay hands on
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that golden key that opes the palace of
        eternity,”</span> and so to pass from this world of shadows and
        sorrow to a world of untroubled light and joy. If this is a dream, it
        is surely a happy and innocent one, and to those who would wake us
        from it we may murmur with Michael Angelo,</p>

        of his intellectual development man deems himself naturally immortal,
        and imagines that were it not for the baleful arts of sorcerers, who
        cut the vital thread prematurely short, he would live for ever. The

        prevailed universally in that Age of Magic which appears to have
        everywhere preceded the Age of Religion. But in time the sad truth of
        human mortality was borne in upon our primitive philosopher with a
        force of demonstration which no prejudice could resist and no
        sophistry dissemble. Among the manifold influences which combined to
        wring from him a reluctant assent to the necessity of death must be
        numbered the growing influence of religion, which by exposing the
        vanity of magic and of all the extravagant pretensions built on it
        gradually lowered man's proud and defiant attitude towards nature,
        and taught him to believe that there are mysteries in the universe
        which his feeble intellect can never fathom, and forces which his
        puny hands can never control. Thus more and more he learned to bow to
        the inevitable and to console himself for the brevity and the sorrows
        of life on earth by the hope of a blissful eternity hereafter. But if
        he reluctantly acknowledged the existence of beings at once
        superhuman and supernatural, he was as yet far from suspecting the
        width and the depth of the gulf which divided him from them. The gods
        with whom his imagination now peopled the darkness of the unknown
        were indeed admitted by him to be his superiors in knowledge and in
        power, in the joyous splendour of their life and in the length of its
        duration. But, though he knew it not, these glorious and awful beings
        were merely, like the spectre of the Brocken, the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reflections of his own diminutive
        personality exaggerated into gigantic proportions by distance and by
        the mists and clouds upon which they were cast. Man in fact created
        gods in his own likeness and being himself mortal he naturally
        supposed his creatures to be in the same sad predicament. Thus the
        Greenlanders believed that a wind could kill their most powerful god,
        and that he would certainly die if he touched a dog. When they heard
        of the Christian God, they kept asking if he never died, and being
        informed that he did not, they were much surprised, and said that he
        must be a very great god indeed.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2"

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great gods of
        Egypt themselves were not exempt from the common lot. They too grew
        old and died. For like men they were composed of body and soul, and
        like men were subject to all the passions and infirmities of the
        flesh. Their bodies, it is true, were fashioned of more ethereal
        mould, and lasted longer than ours, but they could not hold out for
        ever against the siege of time. Age converted their bones into
        silver, their flesh into gold, and their azure locks into
        lapis-lazuli. When their time came, they passed away from the
        cheerful world of the living to reign as dead gods over dead men in
        the melancholy world beyond the grave. Even their souls, like those
        of mankind, could only endure after death so long as their bodies
        held together; and hence it was as needful to preserve the corpses of
        the gods as the corpses of common folk, lest with the divine body the
        divine spirit should also come to an untimely end. At first their
        remains were laid to rest under the desert sands of the mountains,
        that the dryness of the soil and the purity of the air might protect
        them from putrefaction and decay. Hence one of the oldest titles of
        the Egyptian gods is <span class="tei tei-q">“they who are under the
        sands.”</span> But when at a later time the discovery of the art of
        embalming gave a new lease of life to the souls of the dead by
        preserving their bodies for an indefinite time from corruption, the
        deities were permitted to share the benefit of an invention which
        held out to gods as well as to men a reasonable hope of immortality.
        Every province then had the tomb and mummy of its dead god. The mummy
        of Osiris was to be seen at Mendes; Thinis boasted of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005"
        id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mummy of Anhouri; and
        Heliopolis rejoiced in the possession of that of Toumou.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> But
        while their bodies lay swathed and bandaged here on earth in the
        tomb, their souls, if we may trust the Egyptian priests, shone as
        bright stars in the firmament. The soul of Isis sparkled in Sirius,
        the soul of Horus in Orion, and the soul of Typhon in the Great
        Bear.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=

        death of the god did not involve the extinction of his sacred stock;
        for he commonly had by his wife a son and heir, who on the demise of
        his divine parent succeeded to the full rank, power, and honours of
        the godhead.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
        famous stories of the death of a god is told by Plutarch. It runs
        thus. In the reign of the emperor Tiberius a certain schoolmaster
        named Epitherses was sailing from Greece to Italy. The ship in which
        he had taken his passage was a merchantman and there were many other
        passengers on board. At evening, when they were off the Echinadian
        Islands, the wind died away, and the vessel drifted close in to the
        island of Paxos. Most of the passengers were awake and many were
        still drinking wine after dinner, when suddenly a voice hailed the
        ship from the island, calling upon Thamus. The crew and passengers
        were taken by surprise, for though there was an Egyptian pilot named
        Thamus on board, few knew him even by name. Twice the cry was
        repeated, but Thamus kept silence. However, at the third call he
        answered, and the voice from the shore, now louder than ever, said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“When you are come to Palodes, announce that
        the Great Pan is dead.”</span> Astonishment fell upon all, and they
        consulted whether it would be better to do the bidding of the voice
        or not. At last Thamus resolved that, if the wind held, he would pass
        the place in silence, but if it dropped when they were off Palodes he
        would give the message. Well, when they were come to Palodes, there
        was a great calm; so Thamus standing in the stern and looking towards
        the land cried out, as he had been bidden, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Great Pan is dead.”</span> The words had hardly
        passed his lips when a loud sound of lamentation broke on their ears,
        as if a multitude were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
        007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        mourning. This strange story, vouched for by many on board, soon got
        wind at Rome, and Thamus was sent for and questioned by the emperor
        Tiberius himself, who caused enquiries to be made about the dead
        god.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> In
        modern times, also, the annunciation of the death of the Great Pan
        has been much discussed and various explanations of it have been
        suggested. On the whole the simplest and most natural would seem to
        be that the deity whose sad end was thus mysteriously proclaimed and
        lamented was the Syrian god Tammuz or Adonis, whose death is known to
        have been annually bewailed by his followers both in Greece and in
        his native Syria. At Athens the solemnity fell at midsummer, and
        there is no improbability in the view that in a Greek island a band
        of worshippers of Tammuz should have been celebrating the death of
        their god with the customary passionate demonstrations of sorrow at
        the very time when a ship lay becalmed off the shore, and that in the
        stillness of the summer night the voices of lamentation should have
        been wafted with startling distinctness across the water and should
        have made on the minds of the listening passengers a deep and lasting
        impression.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=

        008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        stories of the same kind found currency in western Asia down to the
        Middle Ages. An Arab writer relates that in the year 1063 or 1064
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, in the reign of the
        caliph Caiem, a rumour went abroad through Bagdad, which soon spread
        all over the province of Irac, that some Turks out hunting in the
        desert had seen a black tent, where many men and women were beating
        their faces and uttering loud cries, as it is the custom to do in the
        East when some one is dead. And among the cries they distinguished
        these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“The great King of the Jinn is
        dead, woe to this country!”</span> In consequence of this a
        mysterious threat was circulated from Armenia to Chuzistan that every
        town which did not lament the dead King of the Jinn should utterly
        perish. Again, in the year 1203 or 1204 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> a fatal disease, which
        attacked the throat, raged in parts of Mosul and Irac, and it was
        divulged that a woman of the Jinn called Umm 'Uncūd or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mother of the Grape-cluster”</span> had lost her son,
        and that all who did not lament for him would fall victims to the
        epidemic. So men and women sought to save themselves from death by
        assembling and beating their faces, while they cried out in a
        lamentable voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“O mother of the
        Grape-cluster, excuse us; the Grape-cluster is dead; we knew it

          sometimes believe that their safety and even that of the world is
          bound up with the life of one of these god-men or human
          incarnations of the divinity. Naturally, therefore, they take the
          utmost care of his life, out of a regard for their own. But no
          amount of care and precaution will prevent the man-god from growing
          old and feeble and at last dying. His worshippers have to lay their
          account with this sad necessity and to meet it as best they can.
          The danger is a formidable one; for if the course of nature is
          dependent on the man-god's life, what catastrophes may not be
          expected from the gradual enfeeblement of his powers and their
          final extinction in death? There is only one way of averting these
          dangers. The man-god must be killed as soon as he shews symptoms
          that his powers are beginning to fail, and his soul must be
          transferred to a vigorous successor before it has been seriously
          impaired by the threatened decay. The advantages of thus
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name=
          "Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> putting the man-god
          to death instead of allowing him to die of old age and disease are,
          to the savage, obvious enough. For if the man-god dies what we call
          a natural death, it means, according to the savage, that his soul
          has either voluntarily departed from his body and refuses to
          return, or more commonly that it has been extracted, or at least
          detained in its wanderings, by a demon or sorcerer.<a id=
          "noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> In any
          of these cases the soul of the man-god is lost to his worshippers;
          and with it their prosperity is gone and their very existence
          endangered. Even if they could arrange to catch the soul of the
          dying god as it left his lips or his nostrils and so transfer it to
          a successor, this would not effect their purpose; for, dying of
          disease, his soul would necessarily leave his body in the last
          stage of weakness and exhaustion, and so enfeebled it would
          continue to drag out a languid, inert existence in any body to
          which it might be transferred. Whereas by slaying him his
          worshippers could, in the first place, make sure of catching his
          soul as it escaped and transferring it to a suitable successor;
          and, in the second place, by putting him to death before his
          natural force was abated, they would secure that the world should
          not fall into decay with the decay of the man-god. Every purpose,
          therefore, was answered, and all dangers averted by thus killing
          the man-god and transferring his soul, while yet at its prime, to a
          vigorous successor.</p>

          reasons for preferring a violent death to the slow death of old age

          spirits of those who die a natural death are excessively feeble and
          weak, as their bodies were at dissolution; whereas the spirits of

          Barongo believe that in the world beyond the grave the spirits of
          their dead ancestors appear with the exact form and lineaments
          which their bodies exhibited at the moment of death; the spirits
          are young or old according as their bodies were young or old when
          they died; there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg

          Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco are persuaded that the souls of
          the departed correspond exactly in form and characteristics to the
          bodies which they quitted at death; thus a tall man is tall, a
          short man is short, and a deformed man is deformed in the
          spirit-land, and the disembodied soul of a child remains a child,
          it never develops into an adult. Hence they burn the body of a
          murderer and scatter the ashes to the winds, thinking that this
          treatment will prevent his spirit from assuming human shape in the
          other world.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href=

          too, the Naga tribes of Manipur hold that the ghost of a dead man
          is an exact image of the deceased as he was at the moment of death,
          with his scars, tattoo marks, mutilations, and all the rest.<a id=

          Baganda think that the ghosts of men who were mutilated in life are
          mutilated in like manner after death; so to avoid that shame they

          men sometimes prefer to kill themselves or to be killed before they
          grow feeble, in order that in the future life their souls may start
          fresh and vigorous as they left their bodies, instead of decrepit
          and worn out with age and disease. Thus in Fiji, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“self-immolation is by no means rare, and they believe
          that as they leave this life, so they will remain ever after. This

          crippled condition, by a voluntary death.”</span><a id="noteref_26"

          another observer of the Fijians puts it more fully, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the custom of voluntary suicide on the part of the old
          men, which is among their most extraordinary usages, is also
          connected with their superstitions respecting a future life. They
          believe that persons enter upon the delights of their elysium with
          the same faculties, mental and physical, that they possess at the
          hour of death, in short, that the spiritual life commences where
          the corporeal existence terminates. With these views, it is natural
          that they should desire to pass through this change before their
          mental and bodily powers are so enfeebled <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class=

          for enjoyment. To this motive must be added the contempt which
          attaches to physical weakness among a nation of warriors, and the
          wrongs and insults which await those who are no longer able to
          protect themselves. When therefore a man finds his strength
          declining with the advance of age, and feels that he will soon be
          unequal to discharge the duties of this life, and to partake in the
          pleasures of that which is to come, he calls together his
          relations, and tells them that he is now worn out and useless, that
          he sees they are all ashamed of him, and that he has determined to
          be buried.”</span> So on a day appointed they used to meet and bury

          he prefers to die. So, on a day appointed, his friends and

          due, because they are thought to be produced by his power, and not
          by nature at the bidding of the Most High God. This power he boasts
          he can impart to others, when and to whom he pleases. He asserts
          that his body cannot die a natural death, and therefore when he
          knows he is near the end of his days, whether it is brought about
          by sickness or age, or whether he is deluded by the demon, he calls
          one of his disciples to whom he wishes to communicate his power, in
          order that he may succeed him. And having made him tie a noose to
          his neck he commands him to strangle him, or to knock him on the
          head with a great cudgel and kill him. His disciple obeys and sends
          him a martyr to the devil, to suffer torments with Lucifer in the
          flames for ever. This tragedy is enacted in public, in order that
          his successor may be manifested, who hath the power of fertilising
          the earth, the power having been imparted to him by the deceased;
          otherwise, so they say, the earth would remain barren, and the

          Ethiopian kings of Meroe were worshipped as gods; but whenever the
          priests chose, they sent a messenger to the king, ordering him to
          die, and alleging an oracle of the gods as their authority for the
          command. This command the kings always obeyed down to the reign of
          Ergamenes, a contemporary of Ptolemy II., King of Egypt. Having
          received a Greek education which emancipated him from the
          superstitions of his countrymen, Ergamenes ventured to disregard
          the command of the priests, and, entering the Golden Temple with a
          body of soldiers, put the priests to the sword.<a id="noteref_43"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Customs of the
          same sort appear to have prevailed in this region down to modern
          times. Thus we are told that in Fazoql, a district in the valley of
          the Blue Nile, to the west of Abyssinia, it was customary, as late
          as the middle of the nineteenth century, to hang a king who was no
          longer beloved. His relatives and ministers assembled round him,
          and announced that as he no longer pleased the men, the women, the
          asses, the oxen, and the fowls of the country, it was better he
          should die. Once on a time, when a king was unwilling to take the
          hint, his own wife and mother urged him so strongly not to disgrace
          himself by disregarding the custom, that he submitted to his fate
          and was strung up in the usual way. In some tribes of Fazoql the
          king had to administer justice daily under a certain tree. If from
          sickness or any other cause he was unable to discharge this duty
          for three whole days, he was hanged on the tree in a noose, which
          contained two razors so arranged that when the noose was drawn
          tight by the weight of the king's body they cut his throat.<a id=

          Fazolglou an annual festival, which partook of the nature of a
          Saturnalia, was preceded by a formal trial of the king in front of
          his house. The judges were the chief men of the country. The king
          sat on his royal stool during the trial, surrounded by armed men,
          who were ready to carry out a sentence of death. A little way off a
          jackal and a dog were tied to a post. The conduct of the king
          during his year of office was discussed, complaints were heard, and
          if the verdict was unfavourable, the king was executed and his
          successor chosen from among the members of his family. But if the
          monarch was acquitted, the people at once paid their homage to him
          afresh, and the dog or the jackal was killed in his stead. This
          custom lasted down to the year 1837 or 1838, when king Yassin was
          thus condemned and executed.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45"

          Afterwards it would seem that the death of the dog was regularly
          accepted as a substitute for the death of the king. At least this
          may be inferred from a later account of the Fazoql practice, which
          runs thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“The meaning of another of their
          customs is quite obscure. At a certain time of the year they have a
          kind of carnival, where every one does what he likes best. Four
          ministers of the king then bear him on an anqareb out of his house
          to an open space of ground; a dog is fastened by a long cord to one
          of the feet of the anqareb. The whole population collects round the
          place, streaming in on every side. They then throw darts and stones
          at the dog, till he is killed, after which the king is again borne
          into his house.”</span><a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=

          C. G. Seligmann, to whose researches I am indebted for the
          following detailed information on the subject.<a id="noteref_48"

          Shilluk are a tribe or nation who inhabit a long narrow fringe of
          territory on the western bank of the White Nile from Kaka in the
          north to Lake No in the south, as well as a strip on the eastern
          bank of the river, which stretches from Fashoda to Taufikia and for
          some thirty-five miles up the Sobat River. The country of the
          Shilluk is almost entirely in grass, hence the principal wealth of
          the people consists in their flocks and herds, but they also grow a
          considerable quantity of the species of millet which is known as
          durra. But though the Shilluk <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> are mainly a pastoral people, they are not
          nomadic, but live in many settled villages. The tribe at present
          numbers about forty thousand souls, and is governed by a single
          king (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ret</span></span>), whose residence is at
          Fashoda. His subjects take great care of him, and hold him in much
          honour. In the old days his word was law and he was not suffered to
          go forth to battle. At the present day he still keeps up
          considerable state and exercises much authority; his decisions on
          all matters brought before him are readily obeyed; and he never
          moves without a bodyguard of from twelve to twenty men. The
          reverence which the Shilluk pay to their king appears to arise
          chiefly from the conviction that he is a reincarnation of the
          spirit of Nyakang, the semi-divine hero who founded the dynasty and
          settled the tribe in their present territory, to which he is
          variously said to have conducted them either from the west or from
          the south. Tradition has preserved the pedigree of the kings from
          Nyakang to the present day. The number of kings recorded between
          Nyakang and the father of the reigning monarch is twenty,
          distributed over twelve generations; but Dr. Seligmann is of
          opinion that many more must have reigned, and that the genealogy of
          the first six or seven kings, as given to him, has been much
          abbreviated. There seems to be no reason to doubt the historical
          character of all of them, though myths have gathered like clouds
          round the persons of Nyakang and his immediate successors. The
          Shilluk about Kodok (Fashoda) think of Nyakang as having been a man
          in appearance and physical qualities, though unlike his royal
          descendants of more recent times he did not die but simply
          disappeared. His holiness is manifested especially by his relation
          to Jŭok, the great god of the Shilluk, who created man and is
          responsible for the order of nature. Jŭok is formless and invisible
          and like the air he is everywhere at once. He is far above Nyakang
          and men alike, but he is not worshipped directly, and it is only
          through the intercession of Nyakang, whose favour the Shilluk
          secure by means of sacrifices, that Jŭok can be induced to send the
          needed rain for the cattle and the crops.<a id="noteref_49" name=

          of rain-giver Nyakang is the great benefactor of the Shilluk. Their
          country, baked by the burning heat of the tropical sun, depends
          entirely for its fertility on the waters of heaven, for the people
          do not resort to artificial irrigation. When the rain falls, then
          the grass sprouts, the millet grows, the cattle thrive, and the
          people have food to eat. Drought brings famine and death in its
          train.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=

          Nyakang is said not only to have brought the Shilluk into their
          present land, but to have made them into a nation of warriors,
          divided the country among them, regulated marriage, and made the
          laws.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=

          religion of the Shilluk at the present time consists mainly of the
          worship paid to this semi-divine hero, the traditionary ancestor of
          their kings. There seems to be no reason to doubt that the
          traditions concerning him are substantially correct; in all
          probability he was simply a man whom the superstition of his
          fellows in his own and subsequent ages has raised to the rank of a
          deity.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=
          "#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> No
          less than ten shrines are dedicated to his worship; the three most
          famous are at Fashoda, Akurwa, and Fenikang. They consist of one or
          more huts enclosed by a fence; generally there are several huts
          within the enclosure, one or more of them being occupied by the
          guardians of the shrine. These guardians are old men, who not only
          keep the hallowed spot scrupulously clean, but also act as priests,
          killing the sacrificial victims which are brought to the shrine,
          sharing their flesh, and taking the skins for themselves. All the
          shrines of Nyakang are called graves of Nyakang (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kengo
          Nyakang</span></span>), though it is well known that nobody is

          spears are kept in all of them and are used to slaughter the
          victims offered in sacrifice at the shrines. The originals of these
          spears are said to have belonged to Nyakang and his companions, but
          they have disappeared and been replaced by others.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two great
          ceremonies are annually performed at the shrines of Nyakang: one of
          them is intended to ensure the fall of rain, the other is
          celebrated at harvest. At the rain-making ceremony, which is held
          before the rains at the beginning of the month <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">alabor</span></span>, a bullock is slain with
          a sacred spear before the door of the shrine, while the king stands
          by praying in a loud voice to Nyakang to send down the refreshing
          showers on the thirsty land. As much of the blood of the victim as
          possible is collected in a gourd and thrown into the river, perhaps
          as a rain-charm. This intention of the sacrifice comes out more
          plainly in a form of the ritual which is said to be observed at
          Ashop. There the sacrificial bullock is speared high up in the
          flank, so that the wound is not immediately fatal. Then the wounded
          animal is allowed and indeed encouraged to walk to and from the
          river before it sinks down and dies. In the blood that streams from
          its side on the ground the people may see a symbol of the
          looked-for rain.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=
          "#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> Care
          is taken not to break the bones of the animal, and they, like the
          blood, are thrown into the river. At the annual rain-making
          ceremony a cow is also dedicated to Nyakang: it is not killed but
          added to the sacred herd of the shrine. The other great annual
          ceremony observed at the shrines of Nyakang falls at harvest. When
          the millet has been reaped, every one brings a portion of the grain
          to a shrine of Nyakang, where it is ground into flour, which is
          made into porridge with water fetched from the river. Then some of
          the porridge is poured out on the threshold of the hut which the
          spirit of Nyakang is supposed to inhabit; some of it is smeared on
          the outer walls of the building; and some of it is emptied out on
          the ground outside. Even before harvest it is customary to bring
          some of the ripening grain from the fields and to thrust it into
          the thatch of the huts in the shrines, no doubt in order to secure
          the blessing of Nyakang on the crops. Sacrifices are also offered
          at these shrines for the benefit of sick people. A sufferer will
          bring or send a sheep to the nearest sanctuary, where the guardians
          will slaughter the animal with a sacred spear and pray for the
          patient's recovery.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a
          fundamental article of the Shilluk creed that the spirit of the
          divine or semi-divine Nyakang is incarnate in the reigning king,
          who is accordingly himself invested to some extent with the
          character of a divinity. But while the Shilluk hold their kings in
          high, indeed religious reverence and take every precaution against
          their accidental death, nevertheless they cherish <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the conviction that the king must not be allowed to
          become ill or senile, lest with his diminishing vigour the cattle
          should sicken and fail to bear their increase, the crops should rot

          prevent these calamities it used to be the regular custom with the
          Shilluk to put the king to death whenever he shewed signs of
          ill-health or failing strength. One of the fatal symptoms of decay
          was taken to be an incapacity to satisfy the sexual passions of his
          wives, of whom he has very many, distributed in a large number of
          houses at Fashoda. When this ominous weakness manifested itself,
          the wives reported it to the chiefs, who are popularly said to have
          intimated to the king his doom by spreading a white cloth over his
          face and knees as he lay slumbering in the heat of the sultry
          afternoon. Execution soon followed the sentence of death. A hut was
          specially built for the occasion: the king was led into it and lay
          down with his head resting on the lap of a nubile virgin: the door
          of the hut was then walled up; and the couple were left without
          food, water, or fire to die of hunger and suffocation. This was the
          old custom, but it was abolished some five generations ago on
          account of the excessive sufferings of one of the kings who
          perished in this way. He survived his companion for some days, and
          in the interval was so distressed by the stench of her putrefying
          body that he shouted to the people, whom he could hear moving
          outside, never again to let a king die in this prolonged and
          exquisite agony. After a time his cries died away into silence;
          death had released him from his sufferings; but since then the
          Shilluk have adopted a quicker and more merciful mode of executing
          their kings. What the exact form of execution has been in later
          times Dr. Seligmann found it very difficult to ascertain,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=

          to the fact of the execution he tells us that there is not the
          least doubt. It is said that the chiefs announce his fate to the
          king, and that afterwards he is strangled in a hut which has been
          specially built for the occasion.</p>

          incipient decay, but even while he was yet in the prime of health
          and strength he might be attacked at any time by a rival and have
          to defend his crown in a combat to the death. According to the
          common Shilluk tradition any son of a king had the right thus to
          fight the king in possession and, if he succeeded in killing him,
          to reign in his stead. As every king had a large harem and many
          sons, the number of possible candidates for the throne at any time
          may well have been not inconsiderable, and the reigning monarch
          must have carried his life in his hand. But the attack on him could
          only take place with any prospect of success at night; for during
          the day the king surrounded himself with his friends and
          bodyguards, and an aspirant to the throne could hardly hope to cut
          his way through them and strike home. It was otherwise at night.
          For then the guards were dismissed and the king was alone in his
          enclosure with his favourite wives, and there was no man near to
          defend him except a few herdsmen, whose huts stood a little way
          off. The hours of darkness were therefore the season of peril for
          the king. It is said that he used to pass them in constant
          watchfulness, prowling round his huts fully armed, peering into the
          blackest shadows, or himself standing silent and alert, like a
          sentinel on duty, in some dark corner. When at last his rival
          appeared, the fight would take place in grim silence, broken only
          by the clash of spears and shields, for it was a point of honour
          with the king not to call the herdsmen to his assistance.<a id=

          election are lacking. So far as Dr. Seligmann could ascertain, the

          for only one day, saying that he was perfectly ready to be killed

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An important
          part of the solemnities attending the accession of a Shilluk king
          appears to be intended to convey to the new monarch the divine
          spirit of Nyakang, which has been transmitted from the founder of
          the dynasty to all his successors on the throne. For this purpose a
          sacred four-legged stool and a mysterious object which bears the
          name of Nyakang himself are brought with much solemnity from the
          shrine of Nyakang at Akurwa to the small village of Kwom near
          Fashoda, where the king elect and the chiefs await their arrival.
          The thing called Nyakang is said to be of cylindrical shape, some
          two or three feet long by six inches broad. The chief of Akurwa
          informed Dr. Seligmann that the object in question is a rude wooden
          figure of a man, which was fashioned long ago at the command of
          Nyakang in person. We may suppose that it represents the divine
          king himself and that it is, or was formerly, supposed to house his
          spirit, though the chief of Akurwa denied to Dr. Seligmann that it
          does so now. Be that as it may, the object plays a prominent part
          at the installation of a new <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> king. When the men of Akurwa arrive at Kwom
          with the sacred stool and the image of Nyakang, as we may call it,
          they engage in a sham fight with the men who are waiting for them
          with the king elect. The weapons used on both sides are simply
          stalks of millet. Being victorious in the mock combat, the men of
          Akurwa escort the king to Fashoda, and some of them enter the
          shrine of Nyakang with the stool. After a short time they bring the
          stool forth again and set it on the ground outside of the sacred
          enclosure. Then the image of Nyakang is placed on the stool; the
          king elect holds one leg of the stool and an important chief holds
          another. The king is surrounded by a crowd of princes and nobles,
          and near him stand two of his paternal aunts and two of his
          sisters. After that a bullock is killed and its flesh eaten by the
          men of certain families called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ororo</span></span>, who are said to be
          descended from the third of the Shilluk kings. Then the Akurwa men
          carry the image of Nyakang into the shrine, and the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ororo</span></span> men place the king elect
          on the sacred stool, where he remains seated for some time,
          apparently till sunset. When he rises, the Akurwa men carry the
          stool back into the shrine, and the king is escorted to three new
          huts, where he stays in seclusion for three days. On the fourth
          night he is conducted quietly, almost stealthily, to his royal
          residence at Fashoda, and next day he shews himself publicly to his
          subjects. The three new huts in which he spent the days of his
          seclusion are then broken up and their fragments cast into the
          river. The installation of a new king generally takes place about
          the middle of the dry season; and it is said that the men of Akurwa
          tarry at Fashoda with the image of Nyakang till about the beginning
          of the rains. Before they leave Fashoda they sacrifice a bullock,
          and at every waddy or bed of a stream that they cross they kill a
          sheep.</p>

          resembles the shrine of Nyakang, consisting of a few huts enclosed
          by a fence; one of the huts is built over the king's grave, the
          others are occupied by the guardians of the shrine. Indeed the
          shrines of Nyakang and the shrines of the kings are scarcely to be
          distinguished from each other, and the religious rituals observed
          at all of them are identical in form and vary only in matters of
          detail, the variations being due apparently to the far greater
          sanctity attributed to the shrines of Nyakang. The grave-shrines of
          the kings are tended by certain old men or women, who correspond to
          the guardians of the shrines of Nyakang. They are usually widows or
          old men-servants of the deceased king, and when they die they are
          succeeded in their office by their descendants. Moreover, cattle
          are dedicated to the grave-shrines of the kings and sacrifices are
          offered at them just as at the shrines of Nyakang. Thus when the
          millet crop threatens to fail or a murrain to break out among the
          cattle, either Nyakang himself or one of his successors on the
          throne will appear to somebody in a dream and demand a sacrifice.
          The dream is reported to the king, who thereupon at once sends a
          cow and a bullock to one or more of the shrines of Nyakang, if it
          was he who appeared in the vision, or to the grave-shrine of the
          particular king whom the dreamer saw in his dream. The bullock is
          then sacrificed and the cow added to the sacred herd belonging to
          the shrine. Further, the harvest ceremony which is performed at the
          shrines of Nyakang is usually, though not necessarily, performed
          also at the grave-shrines of the kings; and, lastly, sick folk send
          animals to be sacrificed as offerings on their behalf at the
          shrines of the kings just as they send them to the shrines of
          Nyakang.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sick people
          have, indeed, a special reason for sacrificing to the spirits of
          the dead kings in the hope of recovery, inasmuch as one of the
          commonest causes of sickness, according to the Shilluk, is the
          entrance of one of these royal spirits into the body of the
          sufferer, whose first care, therefore, is to rid himself as quickly
          as possible of his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg
          026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          august but unwelcome guest. Apparently, however, it is only the
          souls of the early kings who manifest themselves in this
          disagreeable fashion. Dr. Seligmann met with a woman, for example,
          who had been ill and who attributed her illness to the spirit of
          Dag, the second of the Shilluk kings, which had taken possession of
          her body. But a sacrifice of two sheep had induced the spirit to
          quit her, and she wore anklets of beads, with pieces of the ears of
          the sheep strung on them, which she thought would effectually guard
          her against the danger of being again possessed by the soul of the
          dead king. Nor is it only in sickness that the souls of dead kings
          are thought to take possession of the bodies of the living. Certain
          men and women, who bear the name of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ajuago</span></span>, are believed to be
          permanently possessed by the spirit of one or other of the early
          kings, and in virtue of this inspiration they profess to heal the
          sick and do a brisk trade in amulets. The first symptom of
          possession may take the form of illness or of a dream from which
          the sleeper awakes trembling and agitated. A long and complicated
          ceremony follows to abate the extreme force of the spiritual
          manifestations in the new medium, for were these to continue in
          their first intensity he would not dare to approach his women. But
          whichever of the dead kings may manifest himself to the living,
          whether in dreams or in the form of bodily possession, his spirit
          is deemed, at least by many of the Shilluk, to be identical with
          that of Nyakang; they do not clearly distinguish, if indeed they
          distinguish at all, between the divine spirit of the founder of the
          dynasty and its later manifestations in all his royal
          successors.</p>

              kings put to death in order to preserve their divine spirit

              crops, the cattle, and mankind.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In general the
          principal element in the religion of the Shilluk would seem to be
          the worship which they pay to their sacred or divine kings, whether
          dead or alive. These are believed to be animated by a single divine
          spirit, which has been transmitted from the semi-mythical, but
          probably in substance historical, founder of the dynasty through
          all his successors to the present day. Yet the divine spirit, as
          Dr. Seligmann justly observes, is clearly not thought of as
          congenital in the members of the royal house; it is only conveyed
          to each king on his accession by means of the mysterious object
          called Nyakang, in which, as Dr. Seligmann with great <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> probability conjectures, the holy
          spirit of Nyakang may be supposed to reside. Hence, regarding their
          kings as incarnate divinities on whom the welfare of men, of
          cattle, and of the corn implicitly depends, the Shilluk naturally
          pay them the greatest respect and take every care of them; and
          however strange it may seem to us, their custom of putting the
          divine king to death as soon as he shews signs of ill-health or
          failing strength springs directly from their profound veneration
          for him and from their anxiety to preserve him, or rather the
          divine spirit by which he is animated, in the most perfect state of
          efficiency: nay, we may go further and say that their practice of
          regicide is the best proof they can give of the high regard in
          which they hold their kings. For they believe, as we have seen,
          that the king's life or spirit is so sympathetically bound up with
          the prosperity of the whole country, that if he fell ill or grew
          senile the cattle would sicken and cease to multiply, the crops
          would rot in the fields, and men would perish of widespread
          disease. Hence, in their opinion, the only way of averting these
          calamities is to put the king to death while he is still hale and
          hearty, in order that the divine spirit which he has inherited from
          his predecessors may be transmitted in turn by him to his successor
          while it is still in full vigour and has not yet been impaired by
          the weakness of disease and old age. In this connexion the
          particular symptom which is commonly said to seal the king's
          death-warrant is highly significant; when he can no longer satisfy
          the passions of his numerous wives, in other words, when he has
          ceased, whether partially or wholly, to be able to reproduce his
          kind, it is time for him to die and to make room for a more
          vigorous successor. Taken along with the other reasons which are
          alleged for putting the king to death, this one suggests that the
          fertility of men, of cattle, and of the crops is believed to depend
          sympathetically on the generative power of the king, so that the
          complete failure of that power in him would involve a corresponding
          failure in men, animals, and plants, and would thereby entail at no
          distant date the entire extinction of all life, whether human,
          animal, or vegetable. No wonder, that with such a danger before
          their eyes the Shilluk should be most careful not to let the king
          die what we should call a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
          028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          natural death of sickness or old age. It is characteristic of their
          attitude towards the death of the kings that they refrain from
          speaking of it as death: they do not say that a king has died but
          simply that he has <span class="tei tei-q">“gone away”</span> like
          his divine ancestors Nyakang and Dag, the two first kings of the
          dynasty, both of whom are reported not to have died but to have
          disappeared. The similar legends of the mysterious disappearance of
          early kings in other lands, for example at Rome and in
          Uganda,<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=
          "#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> may
          well point to a similar custom of putting them to death for the
          purpose of preserving their life.</p>

          both we see a series of divine kings on whose life the fertility of
          men, of cattle, and of vegetation is believed to depend, and who
          are put to death, whether in single combat or otherwise, in order
          that their divine spirit may be transmitted to their successors in
          full vigour, uncontaminated by the weakness and decay of sickness
          or old age, because any such degeneration on the part of the king
          would, in the opinion of his worshippers, entail a corresponding
          degeneration on mankind, on cattle, and on the crops. Some points
          in this explanation of the custom of putting divine kings to death,
          particularly the method of transmitting their divine souls to their
          successors, will be dealt with more fully in the sequel. Meantime

          great age. The nation embraces a number of independent <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tribes, and each tribe is mainly
          composed of the owners of cattle; for the Dinka are essentially a
          pastoral people, passionately devoted to the care of their numerous
          herds of oxen, though they also keep sheep and goats, and the women
          cultivate small quantities of millet (durra) and sesame. The tribes
          have no political union. Each village forms a separate community,
          pasturing its herds together in the same grass-land. With the
          change of the seasons the people migrate with their flocks and
          herds to and from the banks of the Nile. In summer, when the plains
          near the great river are converted into swamps and covered with
          clouds of mosquitoes, the herdsmen and their families drive their
          beasts to the higher land of the interior, where the animals find
          firm ground, abundant fodder, and pools of water at which to slake
          their thirst in the fervour of the noonday heat. Here in the
          clearings of the forest the community takes up its abode, each
          family dwelling by itself in one or more conical huts enclosed by a
          strong fence of stakes and thorn-bushes. It is in the patches of
          open ground about these dwellings that the women grow their scanty
          crops of millet and sesame. The mode of tillage is rude. The stumps
          of the trees which have been felled are left standing to a height
          of several feet; the ground is hacked by the help of a tool between
          a hoe and a spade, and the weeds are uprooted with the hand. Such
          as it is, the crop is exposed to the ravages of apes and elephants
          by night and of birds by day. The hungry blacks do not always wait
          till the corn is ripe, but eat much of it while the ears are still
          green. The cattle are kept in separate parks (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">murahs</span></span>) away from the villages.
          It is in the season of the summer rains that the Dinka are most
          happy and prosperous. Then the cattle find sweet grass, plentiful
          water, coolness and shade in the forest; then the people subsist in
          comfort on the milk of their flocks and herds, supplementing it
          with the millet which they reap and the wild fruits which they
          gather in the forest; then they brew the native beer, then they
          marry and dance by night under the bright moon of the serene
          tropical sky. But in autumn a great change passes over the life of
          the community. When October has come, the rains are over, the grass
          of the pastures is eaten down or withered, the pools are dry;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name=
          "Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thirst compels the
          whole village, with its lowing herds and bleating flocks, to
          migrate to the neighbourhood of the river. Now begins a time of
          privation and suffering. There is no grass for the cattle save in
          some marshy spots, where the herdsman must fight his rivals in
          order to win a meagre supply of fodder for his starveling beasts.
          There is no milk for the people, no fruits on the trees, except a
          bitter sort of acorns, from which a miserable flour is ground to
          stay the pangs of hunger. The lean and famished natives are driven
          to fish in the river for the tubers of water-lilies, to grub in the
          earth for roots, to boil the leaves of trees, and as a last
          resource to drink the blood drawn from the necks of their wretched
          cattle. The gaunt appearance of the people at this season fills the
          beholder with horror. The herds are decimated by famine, but even
          more beasts perish by dysentery and other diseases when the first
          rains cause the fresh grass to sprout.<a id="noteref_61" name=

          that the rain, on which the Dinka are so manifestly dependent for

          he who created the world and established the present order of
          things, and it is he who sends down the rain from the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“rain-place,”</span> his home in the upper regions of
          the air. But according to the Niel Dinka this great being was once
          incarnate in human form. Born of a woman, who descended from the
          sky, he became the ancestor of a clan which has the rain for its
          totem; for the recent researches of Dr. C. G. Seligmann have proved
          that every Dinka tribe is divided into a number of clans, each of
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name=
          "Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reveres as its totem
          a species of animals or plants or other natural objects, such as
          rain or fire. Animal totems seem to be the commonest; amongst them
          are the lion, the elephant, the crocodile, the hippopotamus, the
          fox, the hyaena, and a species of small birds called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amur</span></span>, clouds of which infest the
          cornfields and do great damage to the crops. Each clan speaks of
          its totemic animal or plant as its ancestor and refrains from
          injuring and eating it. Men of the Crocodile clan, for example,
          call themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“Brothers of the
          Crocodile,”</span> and will neither kill nor eat the animal; indeed
          they will not even eat out of any vessel which has held crocodile
          flesh. And as they do not injure crocodiles, so they imagine that
          their crocodile kinsfolk will not injure them; hence men of this
          clan swim freely in the river, even by night, without fear of being
          attacked by the dangerous reptiles. And when the totem is a
          carnivorous animal, members of the clan may propitiate it by
          killing sheep and throwing out the flesh to be devoured by their
          animal brethren either on the outskirts of the village or in the
          river. Members of the Small Bird (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">amur</span></span>) clan perform ceremonies to
          prevent the birds from injuring the crops. The relationship between
          a clan and its animal ancestor or totem is commonly explained by a
          legend that in the beginning an ancestress gave birth to twins, one
          of whom was the totemic animal and the other the human ancestor.
          Like most totemic clans, the clans of the Dinka are exogamous, that
          is, no man may marry a woman of his own clan. The descent of the
          clans is in the paternal line; in other words, every man and woman
          belongs to his or her father's clan, not to that of his or her
          mother. But the Rain clan of the Niel Dinka has for its ancestor,
          as we have seen, the supreme god himself, who deigned to be born of
          a woman and to live for a long time among men, ruling over them,
          till at last he grew very old and disappeared appropriately, like
          Romulus, in a great storm of rain. Shrines erected in his honour
          appear to be scattered all over the Dinka country and offerings are
          made at them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps without
          being unduly rash we may conjecture that the great god of the
          Dinka, who gives them the rain, was indeed, what tradition
          represents him as having been, a man among men, in fact a human
          rain-maker, whom at his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          personage among the Dinka to this day; indeed the men in authority
          whom travellers dub chiefs or sheikhs are in fact the actual or
          potential rain-makers of the tribe or community.<a id="noteref_63"
          name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> Each
          of them is believed to be animated by the spirit of a great
          rain-maker, which has come down to him through a succession of
          rain-makers; and in virtue of this inspiration a successful
          rain-maker enjoys very great power and is consulted on all
          important matters. For example, in the Bor tribe of Dinka at the
          present time there is an old but active rain-maker named Biyordit,
          who is reputed to have immanent in him a great and powerful spirit
          called Lerpiu, and by reason of this reputation he exercises
          immense influence over all the Dinka of the Bor and Tain tribes.
          While the mighty spirit Lerpiu is supposed to be embodied in the
          rain-maker, it is also thought to inhabit a certain hut which
          serves as a shrine. In front of the hut stands a post to which are
          fastened the horns of many bullocks that have been sacrificed to
          Lerpiu; and in the hut is kept a very sacred spear which bears the
          name of Lerpiu and is said to have fallen from heaven six
          generations ago. As fallen stars are also called Lerpiu, we may
          suspect that an intimate connexion is supposed to exist between
          meteorites and the spirit which animates the rain-maker; nor would
          such a connexion seem unnatural to the savage, who observes that
          meteorites and rain alike descend from the sky. In spring, about
          the month of April, when the new moon is a few days old, a
          sacrifice of bullocks is offered to Lerpiu for the purpose of
          inducing him to move Dengdit, the great heavenly rain-maker, to
          send down rain on the parched and thirsty earth. Two bullocks are
          led twice round the shrine and afterwards tied by the rain-maker to
          the post in front of it. Then the drums beat and the people, old
          and young, men and women, dance round the shrine and sing, while
          the beasts are being sacrificed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lerpiu,
          our ancestor, we have brought you a sacrifice. Be <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pleased to cause rain to fall.”</span>
          The blood of the bullocks is collected in a gourd, boiled in a pot
          on the fire, and eaten by the old and important people of the clan.
          The horns of the animals are attached to the post in front of the
          shrine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite, or
          rather in virtue, of the high honour in which he is held, no Dinka
          rain-maker is allowed to die a natural death of sickness or old
          age; for the Dinka believe that if such an untoward event were to
          happen, the tribe would suffer from disease and famine, and the
          herds would not yield their increase. So when a rain-maker feels
          that he is growing old and infirm, he tells his children that he
          wishes to die. Among the Agar Dinka a large grave is dug and the
          rain-maker lies down in it on his right side with his head resting
          on a skin. He is surrounded by his friends and relatives, including
          his younger children; but his elder children are not allowed to
          approach the grave lest in their grief and despair they should do
          themselves a bodily injury. For many hours, generally for more than
          a day, the rain-maker lies without eating or drinking. From time to
          time he speaks to the people, recalling the past history of the
          tribe, reminding them how he has ruled and advised them, and
          instructing them how they are to act in the future. Then, when he
          has concluded his admonition, he tells them that it is finished and
          bids them cover him up. So the earth is thrown down on him as he
          lies in the grave, and he soon dies of suffocation. Such, with
          minor variations, appears to be the regular end of the honourable
          career of a rain-maker in all the Dinka tribes. The Khor-Adar Dinka
          told Dr. Seligmann that when they have dug the grave for their
          rain-maker they strangle him in his house. The father and paternal
          uncle of one of Dr. Seligmann's informants had both been
          rain-makers and both had been killed in the most regular and
          orthodox fashion. Even if a rain-maker is quite young he will be
          put to death should he seem likely to perish of disease. Further,
          every precaution is taken to prevent a rain-maker from dying an
          accidental death, for such an end, though not nearly so serious a
          matter as death from illness or old age, would be sure to entail
          sickness on the tribe. As soon as a rain-maker is killed, his
          valuable spirit is supposed to pass to a suitable successor,
          whether a son or other near blood relation.</p><span class=

          expedition the following account of the manner in which the
          Matiamvo comes by his end. <span class="tei tei-q">“It has been
          customary,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“for our
          Matiamvos to die either in war or by a violent death, and the
          present Matiamvo must meet this last fate, as, in consequence of
          his great exactions, he has lived long enough. When we come to this
          understanding, and decide that he should be killed, we invite him
          to make war with our enemies, on which occasion we all accompany
          him and his family to the war, when we lose some of our people. If
          he escapes unhurt, we return to the war again and fight for three
          or four days. We then suddenly abandon him and his family to their
          fate, leaving him in the enemy's hands. Seeing himself thus
          deserted, he causes his throne to be erected, and, sitting down,
          calls his family around him. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> He then orders his mother to approach; she
          kneels at his feet; he first cuts off her head, then decapitates
          his sons in succession, next his wives and relatives, and, last of
          all, his most beloved wife, called Anacullo. This slaughter being
          accomplished, the Matiamvo, dressed in all his pomp, awaits his own
          death, which immediately follows, by an officer sent by the
          powerful neighbouring chiefs, Caniquinha and Canica. This officer
          first cuts off his legs and arms at the joints, and lastly he cuts
          off his head; after which the head of the officer is struck off.
          All the potentates retire from the encampment, in order not to
          witness his death. It is my duty to remain and witness his death,
          and to mark the place where the head and arms have been deposited
          by the two great chiefs, the enemies of the Matiamvo. They also
          take possession of all the property belonging to the deceased
          monarch and his family, which they convey to their own residence. I
          then provide for the funeral of the mutilated remains of the late
          Matiamvo, after which I retire to his capital and proclaim the new
          government. I then return to where the head, legs, and arms have
          been deposited, and, for forty slaves, I ransom them, together with
          the merchandise and other property belonging to the deceased, which
          I give up to the new Matiamvo, who has been proclaimed. This is
          what has happened to many Matiamvos, and what must happen to the
          present one.”</span><a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears to
          have been a Zulu custom to put the king to death as soon as he
          began to have wrinkles or grey hairs. At least this seems implied
          in the following passage written by one who resided for some time
          at the court of the notorious Zulu tyrant Chaka, in the early part
          of the nineteenth century: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          extraordinary violence of the king's rage with me was mainly
          occasioned by that absurd nostrum, the hair oil, with the notion of
          which Mr. Farewell had impressed him as being a specific for
          removing all indications of age. From the first moment of his
          having heard that such a preparation was attainable, he evinced a
          solicitude to procure it, and on every occasion never forgot to
          remind us of his anxiety respecting it; more especially on our
          departure on the mission his injunctions were particularly directed
          to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name=
          "Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this object. It will
          be seen that it is one of the barbarous customs of the Zoolas in
          their choice or election of their kings that he must neither have
          wrinkles nor grey hairs, as they are both distinguishing marks of
          disqualification for becoming a monarch of a warlike people. It is
          also equally indispensable that their king should never exhibit
          those proofs of having become unfit and incompetent to reign; it is
          therefore important that they should conceal these indications so
          long as they possibly can. Chaka had become greatly apprehensive of
          the approach of grey hairs; which would at once be the signal for
          him to prepare to make his exit from this sublunary world, it being
          always followed by the death of the monarch.”</span><a id=

          that he did so by the simple and perfectly sufficient process of
          being knocked on the head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          putting kings to death as soon as they suffered from any personal
          defect prevailed two centuries ago in the Caffre kingdom of Sofala,
          to the north of the present Zululand. We have seen that these kings
          of Sofala, each of whom bore the official name of Quiteve, were
          regarded as gods by their people, being entreated to give rain or
          sunshine, according as each might be wanted.<a id="noteref_71"

          Nevertheless a slight bodily blemish, such as the loss of a tooth,
          was considered a sufficient cause for putting one of these god-men
          to death, as we learn from the following passage of an old
          Portuguese historian: <span class="tei tei-q">“It was formerly the
          custom of the kings of this land to commit suicide by taking poison
          when any disaster or natural physical defect fell upon them, such
          as impotence, infectious disease, the loss of their front teeth, by
          which they were disfigured, or any other deformity or affliction.
          To put an end to such defects they killed themselves, saying that
          the king should be free from any blemish, and if not, it was better
          for his honour that he should die and seek another life where he
          would be made whole, for there <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> everything was perfect. But the Quiteve who
          reigned when I was in those parts would not imitate his
          predecessors in this, being discreet and dreaded as he was; for
          having lost a front tooth he caused it to be proclaimed throughout
          the kingdom that all should be aware that he had lost a tooth and
          should recognise him when they saw him without it, and if his
          predecessors killed themselves for such things they were very
          foolish, and he would not do so; on the contrary, he would be very
          sorry when the time came for him to die a natural death, for his
          life was very necessary to preserve his kingdom and defend it from
          his enemies; and he recommended his successors to follow his
          example.”</span><a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href=
          "#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> The
          same historian tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“near the
          kingdom of Quiteve is another of which Sedanda is king, the laws
          and customs of which are very similar to those of Quiteve, all
          these Kaffirs being of the same nation, and these two kingdoms
          having formerly been one, as I shall relate hereafter. When I was
          in Sofala it happened that King Sedanda was seized with a severe
          and contagious leprosy, and seeing that his complaint was
          incurable, having named the prince who was to succeed him, he took
          poison and died, according to the custom of those kings when they
          are afflicted with any physical deformity.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king of
          Sofala who dared to survive the loss of his front tooth was thus a
          bold reformer like Ergamenes, king of Ethiopia. We may conjecture
          that the ground for putting the Ethiopian kings to death was, as in
          the case of the Zulu and Sofala kings, the appearance on their
          person of any bodily defect or sign of decay; and that the oracle
          which the priests alleged as the authority for the royal execution
          was to the effect that great calamities would result from the reign
          of a king who had any blemish on his body; just as an oracle warned
          Sparta against a <span class="tei tei-q">“lame reign,”</span> that
          is, the reign of a lame king.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74"

          some confirmation of this conjecture that the kings of Ethiopia
          were chosen for their size, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          this day the Sultan of Wadai must have no obvious bodily defect,
          and the king of Angoy cannot be crowned if he has a single blemish,
          such as a broken or a filed tooth or the scar of an old
          wound.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href=

          According to the Book of Acaill and many other authorities no king
          who was afflicted with a personal blemish might reign over Ireland
          at Tara. Hence, when the great King Cormac Mac Art lost one eye by
          an accident, he at once abdicated.<a id="noteref_77" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> It is
          only natural, therefore, to suppose, especially with the other
          African examples before us, that any bodily defect or symptom of
          old age appearing on the person of the Ethiopian monarch was the
          signal for his execution. At a later time it is recorded that if
          the king of Ethiopia became maimed in any part of his body all his
          courtiers had to suffer the same mutilation.<a id="noteref_78"
          name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> But
          this rule may perhaps have been instituted at the time when the
          custom of killing the king for any personal defect was abolished;
          instead of compelling the king to die because, for example, he had
          lost a tooth, all his subjects would be obliged to lose a tooth,
          and thus the invidious superiority of the subjects over the king
          would be cancelled. A rule of this sort is still observed in the
          same region at the court of the Sultans of Darfur. When the Sultan
          coughs, every one makes the sound <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ts
          ts</span></span> by striking the tongue against the root of the
          upper teeth; when he sneezes, the whole assembly utters a sound
          like the cry of the jeko; when he falls off his horse, all his
          followers must fall off likewise; if any one of them remains in the
          saddle, no matter how high his rank, he is laid on the ground and
          beaten.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href=

          journey to the north-east of Abomey, the old capital of Dahomey,
          lies the kingdom of Eyeo. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Eyeos are
          governed by a king, no less absolute than the king of Dahomy, yet
          subject to a regulation of state, at once humiliating and
          extraordinary. When the people have conceived an opinion of his
          ill-government, which is sometimes insidiously infused into them by
          the artifice of his discontented ministers, they send a deputation
          to him with a present of parrots' eggs, as a mark of its
          authenticity, to represent to him that the burden of government
          must have so far fatigued him that they consider it full time for
          him to repose from his cares and indulge himself with a little
          sleep. He thanks his subjects for their attention to his ease,
          retires to his own apartment as if to sleep, and there gives
          directions to his women to strangle him. This is immediately
          executed, and his son quietly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          holding the reins of government no longer than whilst he merits the
          approbation of the people.”</span> About the year 1774, a king of
          Eyeo, whom his ministers attempted to remove in the customary
          manner, positively refused to accept the proffered parrots' eggs at
          their hands, telling them that he had no mind to take a nap, but on
          the contrary was resolved to watch for the benefit of his subjects.
          The ministers, surprised and indignant at his recalcitrancy, raised
          a rebellion, but were defeated with great slaughter, and thus by
          his spirited conduct the king freed himself from the tyranny of his
          councillors and established a new precedent for the guidance of his
          successors.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href=

          However, the old custom seems to have revived and persisted until
          late in the nineteenth century, for a Catholic missionary, writing
          in 1884, speaks of the practice as if it were still in vogue.<a id=

          Another missionary, writing in 1881, thus describes the usage of
          the Egbas and the Yorubas of west Africa: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Among the customs of the country one of the most
          curious is unquestionably that of judging and punishing the king.
          Should he have earned the hatred of his people by exceeding his
          rights, one of his councillors, on whom the heavy duty is laid,
          requires of the prince that he shall <span class="tei tei-q">‘go to
          sleep,’</span> which means simply <span class="tei tei-q">‘take
          poison and die.’</span> If his courage fails him at the supreme
          moment, a friend renders him this last service, and quietly,
          without betraying the secret, they prepare the people for the news
          of the king's death. In Yoruba the thing is managed a little
          differently. When a son is born to the king of Oyo, they make a
          model of the infant's right foot in clay and keep it in the house
          of the elders (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ogboni</span></span>). If the king fails to
          observe the customs of the country, a messenger, without speaking a
          word, shews him his child's foot. The king knows what that means.
          He takes poison and goes to sleep.”</span><a id="noteref_85" name=

          doubt the truth of this last tradition. Fanaticism or the mere love
          of notoriety has led men in other ages and other lands to court
          death in the flames. In antiquity the mountebank Peregrinus, after
          bidding for fame in the various characters of a Christian martyr, a
          shameless cynic, and a rebel against Rome, ended his disreputable
          and vainglorious career by publicly burning himself at the Olympic
          festival in the presence of a crowd of admirers and scoffers, among
          whom was the satirist Lucian.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87"

          Buddhist monks in China sometimes seek to attain Nirvana by the
          same method, the flame of their religious zeal being fanned by a
          belief that the merit of their death redounds to the good of the
          whole community, while the praises which are showered upon them in
          their lives, and the prospect of the honours and worship which
          await them after death, serve as additional incentives to suicide.
          The beautiful mountains of Tien-tai, in the district of Tai-chow,
          are, or were till lately, the scene of many such voluntary
          martyrdoms. The victims are monks who, weary of the vanities of
          earth, have withdrawn even from their monasteries and spent years
          alone in one or other of the hermitages which are scattered among
          the ravines and precipices of this wild and secluded region. Their
          fancy having been wrought and their resolution strung to the
          necessary pitch by a life of solitude and brooding contemplation,
          they announce their intention and fix the day of their departure
          from this world of shadows, always choosing for that purpose a
          festival which draws a crowd of worshippers and pilgrims to one of
          the many monasteries of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
          043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the district. Advertisements of the approaching solemnity are
          posted throughout the country, and believers are invited to attend
          and assist the martyrs with their prayers. From three to five monks
          are said thus to commit themselves to the flames every year at
          Tien-tai. They prepare by fasting and ablution for the last fiery
          trial of their faith. An upright chest containing a seat is placed
          in a brick furnace, and the space between the chest and the walls
          of the furnace is filled with fuel. The doomed man takes his seat
          in the chest; the door is shut on him and barred; fire is applied
          to the combustibles, and consumes the candidate for heaven. When
          all is over, the charred remains are raked together, worshipped,
          and reverently buried in a dagoba or shrine destined for the
          preservation and worship of the relics of saints. The victims, it
          is said, are not always voluntary. In remote districts unscrupulous
          priests have been known to stupefy a clerical brother with drugs
          and then burn him publicly, an unwilling martyr, as a means of
          spreading the renown of the monastery and thereby attracting the
          alms of the faithful. On the twenty-eighth of January 1888 the
          Spiritual-hill monastery, distant about a day's journey from the
          city of Wen-chow, witnessed the voluntary death by fire of two
          monks who bore the euphonious names of Perceptive-intelligence and
          Effulgent-glamour. Before they entered the furnaces, the spectators
          prayed them to become after death the spiritual guardians of the
          neighbourhood, to protect it from all evil influences, and to grant
          luck in trade, fine seasons, plentiful harvests, and every other
          blessing. The martyrs complaisantly promised to comply with these
          requests, and were thereupon worshipped as living Buddhas, while a
          stream of gifts poured into the coffers of the monastery.<a id=

          of Christian fanaticism. In the seventeenth century the internal
          troubles of their unhappy country, viewed in the dim light of
          prophecy, created a widespread belief among the Russian people that
          the end of the world was at hand, and that the reign of Antichrist

          simple mathematical calculation, based on these irrefragable data,

          date when the final consummation of all things and the arrival of
          the Beast in question might be confidently anticipated. When the
          year came and went and still, to the general surprise, the animal
          failed to put in an appearance, the calculations were revised, it
          was discovered that an error had crept into them, and the world was
          respited for another thirty-three years. But though opinions
          differed as to the precise date of the catastrophe, the pious were
          unanimous in their conviction of its proximity. Accordingly some of
          them ceased to till their fields, abandoned their houses, and on
          certain nights of the year expected the sound of the last trump in
          coffins which they took the precaution of closing, lest their
          senses, or what remained of them, should be overpowered by the
          awful vision of the Judgment Day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would have
          been well if the delusion of their disordered intellects had
          stopped there. Unhappily in many cases it went much further, and
          suicide, universal suicide, was preached by fervent missionaries as
          the only means to escape the snares of Antichrist and to pass from
          the sins and sorrows of this fleeting world to the eternal joys of
          heaven. Whole communities hailed with enthusiasm the gospel of
          death, and hastened to put its precepts in practice. An epidemic of
          suicide raged throughout northern and north-eastern Russia. At
          first the favourite mode of death was by starvation. In the forest
          of Vetlouga, for example, an old man founded an establishment for
          the use of religious suicides. It was a building without doors and
          windows. The aspirants to heaven were lowered into it through a
          hole in the roof, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg
          045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the hatch was battened down on them, and men armed with clubs
          patrolled the outer walls to prevent the prisoners from escaping.
          Hundreds of persons thus died a lingering death. At first the
          sounds of devotion issued from the walls; but as time went on these
          were replaced by entreaties for food, prayers for mercy, and
          finally imprecations on the miscreant who had lured these misguided
          beings to destruction and on the parents who had brought them into
          the world to suffer such exquisite torments. Thus death by famine
          was attended by some obvious disadvantages. It was slow: it opened
          the door to repentance: it occasionally admitted of rescue.
          Accordingly death by fire was preferred as surer and more
          expeditious. Priests, monks, and laymen scoured the villages and
          hamlets preaching salvation by the flames, some of them decked in
          the spoils of their victims; for the motives of the preachers were
          often of the basest sort. They did not spare even the children, but
          seduced them by promises of the gay clothes, the apples, the nuts,
          the honey they would enjoy in heaven. Sometimes when the people
          hesitated, these infamous wretches decided the wavering minds of
          their dupes by a false report that the troops were coming to
          deliver them up to Antichrist, and so to rob them of a blissful
          eternity. Then men, women, and children rushed into the flames.
          Sometimes hundreds, and even thousands, thus perished together. An
          area was enclosed by barricades, fuel was heaped up in it, the
          victims huddled together, fire set to the whole, and the sacrifice
          consummated. Any who in their agony sought to escape were driven or
          thrown back into the flames, sometimes by their own relations.
          These sinister fires generally blazed at night, reddening the sky
          till daybreak. In the morning nothing remained but charred bodies
          gnawed by prowling dogs; but the stench of burnt human flesh
          poisoned the air for days afterwards.<a id="noteref_92" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the
          Christians expected the arrival of Antichrist in the year 1666, so
          the Jews cheerfully anticipated the long-delayed advent of their
          Messiah in the same fateful year. A Jew of Smyrna, by name
          Sabatei-Sevi, availed himself of this general expectation to pose
          as the Messiah in person. He was greeted with enthusiasm. Jews from
          many parts of Europe hastened to pay their homage and, what was
          still better, their money to the future deliverer of his country,
          who in return parcelled out among them, with the greatest
          liberality, estates in the Holy Land which did not belong to him.
          But the alternative of death by impalement or conversion to
          Mohammedanism, which the Sultan submitted to his consideration,
          induced him to revise his theological opinions, and on looking into
          the matter more closely he discovered that his true mission in life
          was to preach the total abolition of the Jewish religion and the
          substitution for it of Islam.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the cases
          hitherto described, the divine king or priest is suffered by his
          people to retain office until some outward defect, some visible
          symptom of failing health or advancing age, warns them that he is
          no longer equal to the discharge of his divine duties; but not
          until such symptoms have made their appearance is he put to death.
          Some peoples, however, appear to have thought it unsafe to wait for
          even the slightest symptom of decay and have preferred to kill the
          king while he was still in the full vigour of life. Accordingly,
          they have fixed a term beyond which he might not reign, and at the
          close of which he must die, the term fixed upon being short enough
          to exclude the probability of his degenerating physically in the
          interval. In some parts of southern India the period fixed was
          twelve years. Thus, according to an old traveller, in the province
          of Quilacare, about twenty leagues to the north-east of Cape
          Comorin, <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a Gentile house of
          prayer, in which there is an idol which they hold in great account,
          and every twelve <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg
          047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          years they celebrate a great feast to it, whither all the Gentiles
          go as to a jubilee. This temple possesses many lands and much
          revenue: it is a very great affair. This province has a king over
          it, who has not more than twelve years to reign from jubilee to
          jubilee. His manner of living is in this wise, that is to say: when
          the twelve years are completed, on the day of this feast there
          assemble together innumerable people, and much money is spent in
          giving food to Bramans. The king has a wooden scaffolding made,
          spread over with silken hangings: and on that day he goes to bathe
          at a tank with great ceremonies and sound of music, after that he
          comes to the idol and prays to it, and mounts on to the
          scaffolding, and there before all the people he takes some very
          sharp knives, and begins to cut off his nose, and then his ears,
          and his lips, and all his members, and as much flesh off himself as
          he can; and he throws it away very hurriedly until so much of his
          blood is spilled that he begins to faint, and then he cuts his
          throat himself. And he performs this sacrifice to the idol, and
          whoever desires to reign other twelve years and undertake this
          martyrdom for love of the idol, has to be present looking on at
          this: and from that place they raise him up as king.”</span><a id=

          Formerly the Samorin had to cut his throat in public at the end of
          a twelve years' reign. But towards the end of the seventeenth
          century the rule had been modified as follows: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Many strange customs were observed in this country in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name=
          "Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> former times, and
          some very odd ones are still continued. It was an ancient custom
          for the Samorin to reign but twelve years, and no longer. If he
          died before his term was expired, it saved him a troublesome
          ceremony of cutting his own throat, on a publick scaffold erected
          for the purpose. He first made a feast for all his nobility and
          gentry, who are very numerous. After the feast he saluted his
          guests, and went on the scaffold, and very decently cut his own
          throat in the view of the assembly, and his body was, a little
          while after, burned with great pomp and ceremony, and the grandees
          elected a new Samorin. Whether that custom was a religious or a
          civil ceremony, I know not, but it is now laid aside. And a new
          custom is followed by the modern Samorins, that jubilee is
          proclaimed throughout his dominions, at the end of twelve years,
          and a tent is pitched for him in a spacious plain, and a great
          feast is celebrated for ten or twelve days, with mirth and jollity,
          guns firing night and day, so at the end of the feast any four of
          the guests that have a mind to gain a crown by a desperate action,
          in fighting their way through 30 or 40,000 of his guards, and kill
          the Samorin in his tent, he that kills him succeeds him in his
          empire. In anno 1695, one of those jubilees happened, and the tent
          pitched near Pennany, a seaport of his, about fifteen leagues to
          the southward of Calicut. There were but three men that would
          venture on that desperate action, who fell in, with sword and
          target, among the guard, and, after they had killed and wounded
          many, were themselves killed. One of the desperados had a nephew of
          fifteen or sixteen years of age, that kept close by his uncle in
          the attack on the guards, and, when he saw him fall, the youth got
          through the guards into the tent, and made a stroke at his
          Majesty's head, and had certainly despatched him if a large brass
          lamp which was burning over his head had not marred the blow; but,
          before he could make another, he was killed by the guards; and, I
          believe, the same Samorin reigns yet. I chanced to come that time
          along the coast and heard the guns for two or three days and nights
          successively.”</span><a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=

          assistance of the reigning king, and from his work it is possible
          to gain an accurate conception both of the tragedy and of the scene

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The festival at
          which the king of Calicut staked his crown and his life on the
          issue of battle was known as the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Maha
          Makham</span></span> or Great Sacrifice. It fell every twelfth
          year, when the planet Jupiter was in retrograde motion in the sign
          of the Crab, and it lasted twenty-eight days, culminating at the
          time of the eighth lunar asterism in the month of Makaram. As the
          date of the festival was determined by the position of Jupiter in
          the sky, and the interval between two festivals was twelve years,
          which is roughly Jupiter's period of revolution round the
          sun,<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href=
          "#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> we may
          conjecture that the splendid planet was supposed to be in a special
          sense the king's star and to rule his destiny, the period of its
          revolution in heaven corresponding to the period of his reign on
          earth. However that may be, the ceremony was observed with great
          pomp at the Tirunavayi temple, on the north bank of the Ponnani
          River. The spot is close to the present railway line. As the train
          rushes by, you can just catch a glimpse of the temple, almost
          hidden behind a clump of trees on the river bank. From the western
          gateway of the temple a perfectly straight road, hardly raised
          above the level of the surrounding rice-fields and shaded by a fine
          avenue, runs for half a mile to a high ridge with a precipitous
          bank, on which the outlines of three or four terraces can still be
          traced. On the topmost of these terraces the king took his stand on
          the eventful day. The view which it commands is a fine one. Across
          the flat <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg

          expanse of the rice-fields, with the broad placid river winding
          through them, the eye ranges eastward to high tablelands, their
          lower slopes embowered in woods, while afar off looms the great
          chain of the western Ghauts, and in the furthest distance the
          Neilgherries or Blue Mountains, hardly distinguishable from the
          azure of the sky above.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was not
          to the distant prospect that the king's eyes naturally turned at
          this crisis of his fate. His attention was arrested by a spectacle
          nearer at hand. For all the plain below was alive with troops,
          their banners waving gaily in the sun, the white tents of their
          many camps standing sharply out against the green and gold of the
          rice-fields. Forty thousand fighting men or more were gathered
          there to defend the king. But if the plain swarmed with soldiers,
          the road that cuts across it from the temple to the king's stand
          was clear of them. Not a soul was stirring on it. Each side of the
          way was barred by palisades, and from the palisades on either hand
          a long hedge of spears, held by strong arms, projected into the
          empty road, their blades meeting in the middle and forming a
          glittering arch of steel. All was now ready. The king waved his
          sword. At the same moment a great chain of massy gold, enriched
          with bosses, was placed on an elephant at his side. That was the
          signal. On the instant a stir might be seen half a mile away at the
          gate of the temple. A group of swordsmen, decked with flowers and
          smeared with ashes, has stepped out from the crowd. They have just
          partaken of their last meal on earth, and they now receive the last
          blessings and farewells of their friends. A moment more and they
          are coming down the lane of spears, hewing and stabbing right and
          left at the spearmen, winding and turning and writhing among the
          blades as if they had no bones in their bodies. It is all in vain.
          One after the other they fall, some nearer the king, some further
          off, content to die, not for the shadow of a crown, but for the
          mere sake of approving their dauntless valour and swordsmanship to
          the world. On the last days of the festival the same magnificent
          display of gallantry, the same useless sacrifice of life was
          repeated again and again. Yet perhaps no sacrifice is wholly

          little of hereditary descent in succession to the sovereignty.
          There is a throne allotted for the king; there is, in like manner,
          a seat or station assigned for each of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">mansabdars</span></span>. It is that throne
          and these stations alone which engage the reverence of the people
          of Bengal. A set of dependents, servants, and attendants are
          annexed to each of these situations. When the king wishes to
          dismiss or appoint any person, whosoever is placed in the seat of
          the one dismissed is immediately attended and obeyed by the whole
          establishment of dependents, servants, and retainers annexed to the
          seat which he occupies. Nay, this rule obtains even as to the royal
          throne itself. Whoever kills the king, and succeeds in placing
          himself on that throne, is immediately acknowledged as king; all
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          instantly obey and submit to him, and consider him as being as much
          their sovereign as they did their former prince, and obey his
          orders implicitly. The people of Bengal say, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘We are faithful to the throne; whoever fills the
          throne we are obedient and true to it.’</span> ”</span><a id=

          custom of the same sort formerly prevailed in the little kingdom of
          Passier, on the northern coast of Sumatra. The old Portuguese
          historian De Barros, who informs us of it, remarks with surprise
          that no wise man would wish to be king of Passier, since the
          monarch was not allowed by his subjects to live long. From time to
          time a sort of fury seized the people, and they marched through the
          streets of the city chanting with loud voices the fatal words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The king must die!”</span> When the king
          heard that song of death he knew that his hour had come. The man
          who struck the fatal blow was of the royal lineage, and as soon as
          he had done the deed of blood and seated himself on the throne he
          was regarded as the legitimate king, provided <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that he contrived to maintain his seat
          peaceably for a single day. This, however, the regicide did not
          always succeed in doing. When Fernão Peres d'Andrade, on a voyage
          to China, put in at Passier for a cargo of spices, two kings were
          massacred, and that in the most peaceable and orderly manner,
          without the smallest sign of tumult or sedition in the city, where
          everything went on in its usual course, as if the murder or
          execution of a king were a matter of everyday occurrence. Indeed,
          on one occasion three kings were raised to the dangerous elevation
          and followed each other on the dusty road of death in a single day.
          The people defended the custom, which they esteemed very laudable
          and even of divine institution, by saying that God would never
          allow so high and mighty a being as a king, who reigned as his
          vicegerent on earth, to perish by violence unless for his sins he
          thoroughly deserved it.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=

          away from the tropical island of Sumatra a rule of the same sort
          appears to have obtained among the old Slavs. When the captives
          Gunn and Jarmerik contrived to slay the king and queen of the Slavs
          and made their escape, they were pursued by the barbarians, who
          shouted after them that if they would only come back they would
          reign instead of the murdered monarch, since by a public statute of
          the ancients the succession to the throne fell to the king's
          assassin. But the flying regicides turned a deaf ear to promises
          which they regarded as mere baits to lure them back to destruction;
          they continued their flight, and the shouts and clamour of the
          barbarians gradually died away in the distance.<a id="noteref_102"

          bound to suffer death, whether at their own hands or at the hands
          of others, on the expiration of a fixed term of years, it was
          natural that they should seek to delegate the painful duty, along
          with some of the privileges of sovereignty, to a substitute who
          should suffer vicariously in their stead. This expedient appears to
          have been resorted to by some of the princes of Malabar. Thus we
          are informed by a native authority on that country that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in some places <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> all powers both executive and judicial were
          delegated for a fixed period to natives by the sovereign. This
          institution was styled <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          obtained by decapitation. <span class=

          is the name of a supreme authority of those days. The name of the
          office is still preserved in the Cochin state, where the village
          headman is called a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">Thalavettiparothiam</span></span> was a
          terrible but interesting institution. It was an office tenable for
          five years during which its bearer was invested with supreme
          despotic powers within his jurisdiction. On the expiry of the five
          years the man's head was cut off and thrown up in the air amongst a
          large concourse of villagers, each of whom vied with the other in
          trying to catch it in its course down. He who succeeded was
          nominated to the post for the next five years.”</span><a id=

          similar delegation of the duty of dying for his country was perhaps
          practised by the Sultans of Java. At least such a custom would
          explain a strange scene which was witnessed at the court of one of
          these sultans by the famous traveller Ibn Batuta, a native of
          Tangier, who visited the East Indies in the first half of the
          fourteenth century. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“During my
          audience with the Sultan I saw a man who held in his hand a knife
          like that used by a grape-gleaner. He placed it on his own neck and
          spoke for a long time in a language which I did not understand.
          After that he seized the knife with both hands at once and cut his
          throat. His head fell to the ground, so sharp was the blade and so
          great the force with which he used it. I remained dumbfoundered at
          his behaviour, but the Sultan said to me, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Does any one do like that in your country?’</span> I
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Never did I see such a
          thing.’</span> He smiled and replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘These people are our slaves, and they kill themselves
          for love of us.’</span> Then he commanded that they should take
          away him who had slain himself and should burn him. The Sultan's
          officers, the grandees, the troops, and the common people attended
          the cremation. The sovereign assigned a liberal pension to the
          children of the deceased, to his wife, and to his brothers;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name=
          "Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and they were highly
          honoured because of his conduct. A person, who was present at the
          audience when the event I have described took place, informed me
          that the speech made by the man who sacrificed himself set forth
          his devotion to the monarch. He said that he wished to immolate
          himself out of affection for the sovereign, as his father had done
          for love of the prince's father, and as his grandfather had done
          out of regard for the prince's grandfather.”</span><a id=

          may conjecture that formerly the sultans of Java, like the kings of
          Quilacare and Calicut, were bound to cut their own throats at the
          end of a fixed term of years, but that at a later time they deputed
          the painful, though glorious, duty of dying for their country to
          the members of a certain family, who received by way of recompense
          ample provision during their life and a handsome funeral at
          death.</p>

          Friar Jordanus that in the Greater India, by which he seems to mean
          Malabar and the neighbouring regions, many sacrifice themselves to
          the idols. When they are sick or involved in misfortune, they vow
          themselves to the idol in case they are delivered. Then, when they
          have recovered, they fatten themselves for one or two years; and
          when another festival comes round, they cover themselves with
          flowers, crown themselves with white garlands, and go singing and
          playing before the idol, when it is carried through the land.
          There, after they have shown off a great deal, they take a sword
          with two handles, like those used in currying leather, put it to
          the back of their neck, and cutting strongly with both hands sever
          their heads from their bodies before the idol.<a id="noteref_105"

          Again, Nicolo Conti, who travelled in the East in the early part of
          the fifteenth century, informs us that in the city of Cambaita
          <span class="tei tei-q">“many present themselves who have
          determined upon self immolation, having on their neck a broad
          circular piece of iron, the fore part of which is round
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name=
          "Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the hinder part
          extremely sharp. A chain attached to the fore part hangs suspended
          upon the breast, into which the victims, sitting down with their
          legs drawn up and their neck bent, insert their feet. Then, on the
          speaker pronouncing certain words, they suddenly stretch out their
          legs, and at the same time drawing up their neck, cut off their own
          head, yielding up their lives as a sacrifice to their idols. These
          men are regarded as saints.”</span><a id="noteref_106" name=

          the Jaintias or Syntengs, a Khasi tribe of Assam, human sacrifices
          used to be annually offered on the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Sandhi</span></span> day in the month of
          Ashwin. Persons often came forward voluntarily and presented
          themselves as victims. This they generally did by appearing before
          the Rajah on the last day of Shravan and declaring that the goddess
          had called them to herself. After due enquiry, if the would-be
          victim were found suitable, it was customary for the Rajah to
          present him with a golden anklet and to give him permission to live
          as he chose and to do what he liked, the royal treasury undertaking
          to pay compensation for any damage he might do in the exercise of
          his remarkable privileges. But the enjoyment of these privileges
          was very short. On the day appointed the voluntary victim, after
          bathing and purifying himself, was dressed in new attire, daubed
          with red sandal-wood and vermilion, and bedecked with garlands.
          Thus arrayed, he sat for a time in meditation and prayer on a dais
          in front of the goddess; then he made a sign with his finger, and
          the executioner, after uttering the usual formulas, cut off his
          head, which was thereafter laid before the goddess on a golden
          plate. The lungs were cooked and eaten by such <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Kandra
          Yogis</span></span> as were present, and it is said that the royal
          family partook of a small quantity of rice cooked in the blood of
          the victim. The ceremony was usually witnessed by crowds of
          spectators who assembled from all parts of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056"

          voluntary victims fell short, emissaries were sent out to kidnap
          strangers from other territories, and it was the practice of such
          man-hunts that led to the annexation of the Jaintia country by the
          British.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href=

          practice; and accordingly we need not wonder at finding so popular
          an expedient, or traces of it, in many lands. Thus, for example,
          the Bhuiyas are an aboriginal race of north-eastern India, and one
          of their chief seats is Keonjhur. At the installation of a Rajah of
          Keonjhur a ceremony is observed which has been described as follows
          by an English officer who witnessed it: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then the sword, a very rusty old weapon, is placed in
          the Raja's hands, and one of the Bhuiyas, named Anand Kopat, comes
          before him, and kneeling sideways, the Raja touches him on the neck
          as if about to strike off his head, and it is said that in former
          days there was no fiction in this part of the ceremony. The family
          of the Kopat hold their lands on the condition that the victim when
          required shall be produced. Anand, however, hurriedly arose after
          the accolade and disappeared. He must not be seen for three days;
          then he presents himself again to the Raja as miraculously restored
          to life.”</span><a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href=

          the custom of putting the king's proxy to death has dwindled,
          probably under English influence, to a mere pretence; but elsewhere
          it survives, or survived till recent times, in full force.
          Cassange, a native state in the interior of Angola, is ruled by a
          king, who bears the title of Jaga. When a king is about to be
          installed in office, some of the chiefs are despatched to find a
          human victim, who may not be related by blood or marriage to the
          new monarch. When he comes to the king's camp, the victim is
          provided with everything he requires, and all his orders are obeyed
          as promptly as those of the sovereign. On the day of the ceremony
          the king takes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg
          057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          his seat on a perforated iron stool, his chiefs, councillors, and
          the rest of the people forming a great circle round about him.
          Behind the king sits his principal wife, together with all his
          concubines. An iron gong, with two small bells attached to it, is
          then struck by an official, who continues to ring the bells during
          the ceremony. The victim is then introduced and placed in front of
          the king, but with his back towards him. Armed with a scimitar the
          king then cuts open the man's back, extracts his heart, and having
          taken a bite out of it, spits it out and gives it to be burned. The
          councillors meantime hold the victim's body so that the blood from
          the wound spouts against the king's breast and belly, and, pouring
          through the hole in the iron stool, is collected by the chiefs in
          their hands, who rub their breasts and beards with it, while they
          shout, <span class="tei tei-q">“Great is the king and the rites of
          the state!”</span> After that the corpse is skinned, cut up, and
          cooked with the flesh of an ox, a dog, a hen, and some other
          animals. The meal thus prepared is served first to the king, then
          to the chiefs and councillors, and lastly to all the people
          assembled. Any man who refused to partake of it would be sold into
          slavery together with his family.<a id="noteref_109" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scandinavian

          only for periods of nine years, after which they were put to death
          or had to find a substitute to die in their stead. Thus Aun or On,
          king of Sweden, is said to have sacrificed to Odin for length of
          days and to have been answered by the god that he should live so
          long as he sacrificed one of his sons every ninth year. He
          sacrificed nine of them in this manner, and would have sacrificed
          the tenth and last, but the Swedes would not allow him. So he died
          and was buried in a mound at Upsala.<a id="noteref_110" name=

          of a similar tenure of the crown occurs in a curious legend of the
          disposition and banishment of Odin. Offended at his misdeeds, the
          other gods outlawed and exiled him, but set up in his place a
          substitute, Oller by name, a cunning wizard, to whom they accorded
          the symbols both of royalty and of godhead. The deputy bore the
          name of Odin, and reigned for nearly ten years, when he was driven
          from the throne, while the real Odin came to his own again. His
          discomfited rival retired to Sweden and was afterwards slain in an
          attempt to repair his shattered fortunes.<a id="noteref_111" name=

          gods are often merely men who loom large through the mists of

          confused reminiscence of ancient Swedish kings who reigned for nine
          or ten years together, then abdicated, delegating to others the
          privilege of dying for their country. The great festival which was
          held at Upsala every nine years may have been the occasion on which
          the king or his deputy was put to death. We know that human
          sacrifices formed part of the rites.<a id="noteref_112" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some
          grounds for believing that the reign of many ancient Greek kings
          was limited to eight years, or at least that at the end of every
          period of eight years a new consecration, a fresh outpouring of the
          divine grace, was regarded as necessary in order to enable them to
          discharge their civil and religious duties. Thus it was a rule of
          the Spartan constitution that every eighth year the ephors should
          choose a clear and moonless night and sitting down observe the sky
          in silence. If during their vigil they saw a meteor or shooting
          star, they inferred that the king had sinned against the deity, and
          they suspended him from his functions until the Delphic or Olympic
          oracle should reinstate him in them. This custom, which has all the
          air of great antiquity, was not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> suffered to remain a dead letter even in the
          last period of the Spartan monarchy; for in the third century
          before our era a king, who had rendered himself obnoxious to the
          reforming party, was actually deposed on various trumped-up
          charges, among which the allegation that the ominous sign had been

          we compare this custom with the evidence to be presently adduced of
          an eight years' tenure of the kingship in Greece, we shall probably
          agree with K. O. Müller<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href=
          "#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> that
          the quaint Spartan practice was much more than a mere antiquarian
          curiosity; it was the attenuated survival of an institution which
          may once have had great significance, and it throws an important
          light on the restrictions and limitations anciently imposed by
          religion on the Dorian kingship. What exactly was the import of a
          meteor in the opinion of the old Dorians we can hardly hope to
          determine; one thing only is clear, they regarded it as a portent
          of so ominous and threatening a kind that its appearance under
          certain circumstances justified and even required the deposition of
          their king. This exaggerated dread of so simple a natural
          phenomenon is shared by many savages at the present day; and we
          shall hardly err in supposing that the Spartans inherited it from
          their barbarous ancestors, who may have watched with consternation,
          on many a starry night among the woods of Germany, the flashing of
          a meteor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg
          060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          through the sky. It may be well, even at the cost of a digression,
          to illustrate this primitive superstition by examples.</p>

          star is set in the sky, and that as it burns brilliantly or faintly
          he grows rich or poor; finally when he dies it drops from the sky
          in the likeness of a shooting star.<a id="noteref_152" name=

          Similarly in Brittany, Transylvania, Bohemia, the Abruzzi, the
          Romagna, and the Esthonian island of Oesel it is thought by some
          that every man has his own particular star in the sky, and that
          when it falls in the shape of a meteor he expires.<a id=

          is a soul which has just quitted the body, sometimes that it is
          specially the soul of an unbaptized infant or of some one who has
          died without absolution. At sight of it they say that you should
          cross yourself and pray, or that if you wish for something while
          the star is falling you will be sure to get it.<a id="noteref_157"

          the Vosges Mountains in the warm nights of July it is not uncommon
          to see whole showers of shooting stars. It is generally agreed that
          these stars are souls, but some difference of opinion exists as to
          whether they are souls just taking leave of earth, or tortured by
          the fires of purgatory, or on their passage from purgatory to
          heaven.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href=

          downward direction of its flight might naturally suggest a
          different goal; and accordingly other people have seen in the
          transient flame of a meteor the descent of a soul from heaven to be
          born on earth. In the Punjaub, for example, Hindoos believe that
          the length of a soul's residence in the realms of bliss is exactly
          proportioned to the sums which the man distributed in charity
          during his life; and that when these are exhausted his time in

          forbidden direction, he takes care before setting out to bury his

          of these superstitions moved the barbarous Dorians of old to depose
          their kings whenever at a certain season a meteor flamed in the
          sky, we cannot say. Perhaps they had a vague general notion that
          its appearance signified the dissatisfaction of the higher powers
          with the state of the commonwealth; and since in primitive society
          the king is commonly held responsible for all untoward events,
          whatever their origin, the natural course was to relieve him of
          duties which he had proved himself incapable of discharging. But it
          may be that the idea in the minds of these rude barbarians was more
          definite. Possibly, like some people in Europe at the present day,
          they thought that every man had his star in the sky, and that he
          must die when it fell. The king would be no exception to the rule,
          and on a certain night of a certain year, at the end of a cycle, it
          might be customary to watch the sky in order to mark whether the
          king's star was still in the ascendant or near its setting. The
          appearance of a meteor on such a night—of a star precipitated from
          the celestial vault—might prove for the king not merely a symbol
          but a sentence of death. It might be the warrant for his
          execution.</p>

          the regal office was formerly limited among the Spartans to eight
          years, we may naturally ask, why was that precise period selected
          as the measure of a king's reign? The reason is probably to be
          found in those astronomical considerations which determined the
          early Greek calendar. The difficulty of reconciling lunar with
          solar time is one of the standing puzzles which has taxed the
          ingenuity of men who are emerging from barbarism. Now an octennial
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name=
          "Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cycle is the
          shortest period at the end of which sun and moon really mark time
          together after overlapping, so to say, throughout the whole of the
          interval. Thus, for example, it is only once in every eight years
          that the full moon coincides with the longest or shortest day; and
          as this coincidence can be observed with the aid of a simple dial,
          the observation is naturally one of the first to furnish a base for
          a calendar which shall bring lunar and solar times into tolerable,
          though not exact, harmony.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164"

          in early days the proper adjustment of the calendar is a matter of
          religious concern, since on it depends a knowledge of the right
          seasons for propitiating the deities whose favour is indispensable

          wonder, therefore, that the king, as the chief priest of the state,
          or as himself a god, should be liable to deposition or death at the
          end of an astronomical period. When the great luminaries had run
          their course on high, and were about to renew the heavenly race, it
          might well be thought that the king should renew his divine
          energies, or prove them unabated, under pain of making room for a
          more vigorous successor. In southern India, as we have seen, the
          king's reign and life terminated with the revolution of the planet
          Jupiter round the sun. In Greece, on the other hand, the king's
          fate seems to have hung in the balance at the end of every eight
          years, ready to fly up and kick the beam as soon as the opposite
          scale was loaded with a falling star.</p>

          his victim might at any moment issue from its prison-house and
          pounce on him. Once the perturbed spirit had been happily reborn,
          he might be supposed to forgive, if not to forget, the man who had

          whose great palace has been unearthed in recent years, is said to
          have held office for periods of eight years together. At the end of
          each period he retired for a season to the oracular cave on Mount
          Ida, and there communed with his divine father Zeus, giving him an
          account of his kingship in the years that were past, and receiving

          that at the end of every eight years the king's sacred powers
          needed to be renewed by intercourse with the godhead, and that
          without such a renewal he would have forfeited his right to the
          throne. We may surmise that among the solemn ceremonies which
          marked the beginning or the end of the eight years' cycle the
          sacred marriage of the king with the queen played an important
          part, and that in this marriage we have the true explanation of the
          strange legend of Pasiphae and the bull. It was said that Pasiphae,
          the wife of King Minos, fell in love with a wondrous white bull
          which rose from the sea, and that in order to gratify her unnatural
          passion the artist Daedalus constructed a hollow wooden cow,
          covered with a cow's hide, in which the love-sick queen was hidden
          while the bull mounted it. The result of their union was the
          Minotaur, a monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull,
          whom the king shut up in the labyrinth, a building full of such
          winding and intricate passages that the prisoner might roam in it

          Zeus and Europa, and of Minos and Britomartis or Dictynna appear to
          be only different expressions of the same myth, different echoes of
          the same custom. The moon rising from the sea was the fair maiden
          Europa coming across the heaving billows from the far eastern land
          of Phoenicia, borne or pursued by her suitor the solar bull. The
          moon setting in the western waves was the coy Britomartis or
          Dictynna, who plunged into the sea to escape the warm embrace of
          her lover Minos, himself the sun. The story how the drowning maiden
          was drawn up in a fisherman's net may well be, as some have
          thought, the explanation given by a simple seafaring folk of the
          moon's reappearance from the sea in the east after she had sunk
          into it in the west.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href=

          the mythical fancy of the ancients the moon was a coy or a wanton
          maiden, who either fled from or pursued the sun every month till
          the fugitive was overtaken and the lovers enjoyed each other's
          company at the time when the luminaries are in conjunction, namely,
          in the interval between the old and the new moon. Hence on the
          principles of sympathetic magic that interval was considered the
          time most favourable for human marriages. When the sun and moon are
          wedded in the sky, men and women should be wedded on earth. And for
          the same reason the ancients chose the interlunar day for the
          celebration of the Sacred Marriages of gods and goddesses. Similar
          beliefs and customs based on them have been noted among other
          peoples.<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href=

          been expected to exercise their conjugal rights above all at the
          time when the moon was thought to rest in the arms of the sun.
          However that may have been, it would be natural that their union
          should be consummated with unusual solemnity every eight years,
          when the two great luminaries, so to say, meet and mark time
          together once more after diverging from each other more or less
          throughout the interval. It is true that sun and moon are in
          conjunction once every month, but every month their conjunction
          takes place at a different point in the sky, until eight revolving
          years have brought them together again in the same heavenly bridal
          chamber where first they met.</p>

          for another octennial cycle. Traditions varied as to the fate which
          awaited the lads and damsels on their arrival in Crete; but the
          common view appears to have been that they were shut up in the
          labyrinth, there to be devoured by the Minotaur, or at least to be
          imprisoned for life.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href=

          Perhaps they were sacrificed by being roasted alive in a bronze
          image of a bull, or of a bull-headed man, in order to renew the
          strength of the king and of the sun, whom he personated. This at
          all events is suggested by the legend of Talos, a bronze man who
          clutched people to his breast and leaped with them into the fire,
          so that they were roasted alive. He is said to have been given by
          Zeus to Europa, or by Hephaestus to Minos, to guard the island of

          Probably he was identical with the Minotaur, and stripped of his
          mythical features was nothing but a bronze image of the sun
          represented as a man with a bull's head. In order to renew the
          solar fires, human victims may have been sacrificed to the idol by
          being roasted in its hollow body or placed on its sloping hands and
          allowed to roll into a pit of fire. It was in the latter fashion
          that the Carthaginians sacrificed their offspring to Moloch. The
          children were laid on the hands of a calf-headed image of bronze,
          from which they slid into a fiery oven, while the people danced to
          the music of flutes and timbrels to drown the shrieks of the
          burning victims.<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href=

          labyrinth and contrived the wooden cow for Pasiphae was said to
          have made a dance for Ariadne, daughter of Minos. It represented
          youths and maidens dancing in ranks, the youths armed with golden

          Moreover, when Theseus landed with Ariadne in Delos on his return
          from Crete, he and the young companions whom he had rescued from
          the Minotaur are said to have danced a mazy dance in imitation of
          the intricate windings of the labyrinth; on account of its sinuous
          turns the dance was called <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Romans
          that dance appears to have been known from the earliest times by
          the name of Troy or the Game of Troy. Tradition ran that it was
          imported into Italy by Aeneas, who transmitted it through his son
          Ascanius to the Alban kings, who in their turn handed it down to
          the Romans. It was performed by bands of armed youths on horseback.

          that the comparison is more than a mere poetical flourish appears
          from a drawing on a very ancient Etruscan vase found at
          Tragliatella. The drawing represents a procession of seven
          beardless warriors dancing, accompanied by two armed riders on
          horseback, who are also beardless. An inscription proves that the
          scene depicted is the Game of Troy; and attached to the procession

          Labyrinths of similar type occur as decorations on the floors of
          old churches, where they are known as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Road of Jerusalem”</span>; they were used for processions. The
          garden mazes of the Renaissance were modelled on them. Moreover,

          Lappland, and even in Iceland. They go by various names, such as
          Babylon, Wieland's House, Trojeborg, Tröburg, and so forth, some of
          which clearly indicate their connexion with the ancient Game of

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A dance or game
          which has thus spread over Europe and survived in a fashion to
          modern times must have been very popular, and bearing in mind how
          often with the decay of old faiths the serious rites and pageants
          of grown people have degenerated into the sports of children, we
          may reasonably ask whether Ariadne's Dance or the Game of Troy may
          not have had its origin in religious ritual. The ancients connected
          it with Cnossus and the Minotaur. Now we have seen reason to hold,
          with many other scholars, that Cnossus was the seat of a great
          worship of the sun, and that the Minotaur was a representative or
          embodiment of the sun-god. May not, then, Ariadne's dance have been
          an imitation of the sun's course in the sky? and may not its
          intention have been, by means of sympathetic magic, to aid the
          great luminary to run his race on high? We have seen that during an
          eclipse of the sun the Chilcotin Indians walk in a circle, leaning
          on staves, apparently to assist the labouring orb. In Egypt also
          the king, who embodied the sun-god, seems to have solemnly walked
          round the walls of a temple for the sake of helping the sun on his
          way.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> If
          there is any truth in this conjecture, it would seem to follow that
          the sinuous lines of the labyrinth which the dancers followed in
          their evolutions may have represented the ecliptic, the sun's
          apparent annual path in the sky. It is some confirmation of this
          view that on coins of Cnossus the sun or a star appears in the
          middle of the labyrinth, the place which on other coins is occupied
          by the Minotaur.<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href=

          was plainly a late intruder, for his temple lay outside the walls,
          whereas the most ancient sanctuaries stood in the oldest part of
          the city, the low hill which took its name of Cadmea from the

          short, the two festivals appear to have been in origin
          substantially identical; the distinction between them may have
          arisen when the Delphians decided to hold the Pythian games every
          fourth, instead of every eighth year.<a id="noteref_217" name=

          therefore, that the leaf-crowned victors in the Pythian games, like
          the laurel-wreathed boy in the Festival of Crowning, formerly acted
          the part of the god himself. But if in the beginning these actors
          in the sacred drama wore wreaths of oak instead of laurel, it seems
          to follow that the deity whom they personated was the oak-god Zeus
          rather than the laurel-god Apollo; from which again we may infer
          that Delphi was a sanctuary of Zeus and the oak before it became
          the shrine of Apollo and the laurel.<a id="noteref_218" name=

          the oak itself from the neighbourhood of Delphi; in Greece, as in
          Italy, the deciduous trees have for centuries been retreating up

          had long been listened to as oracular, finally succumbed through
          age, or was laid low by a storm, the priests may have cast about
          for a tree of another sort to take its place. Yet they sought it
          neither in the lower woods of the valley nor in the dark forests
          which clothe the upper slopes of Parnassus above the frowning
          cliffs of Delphi. Legend ran that after the slaughter of the
          dragon, Apollo had purged himself from the stain of blood in the
          romantic Vale of Tempe, where the Peneus flows smoothly in a narrow
          defile between the lofty wooded steeps of Olympus and Ossa. Here
          the god crowned himself with a laurel wreath, and thither
          accordingly at the Festival of Crowning his human representative
          went to pluck the laurel for his brows.<a id="noteref_220" name=

          custom, though doubtless ancient, can hardly have been original. We
          must suppose that in the beginning the dragon-guarded tree, whether
          an oak or a laurel, grew at Delphi itself. But why should the
          laurel be chosen as a substitute for the oak? Mr. A. B. Cook has
          suggested a plausible answer. The laurel leaf resembles so closely
          the leaf of the ilex or holm-oak <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          observer may easily confuse the two. The upper surface of both is a
          dark glossy green, the lower surface shews a lighter tint. Nothing,
          therefore, could be more natural than to make the new wreath out of
          leaves which looked so like the old oak leaves that the
          substitution might almost pass undetected.<a id="noteref_221" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether at
          Thebes, as at Delphi, the laurel had ousted the oak from the place
          of honour at the festival of the Slaying of the Dragon, we cannot
          say. The oak has long disappeared from the low hills and flat
          ground in the neighbourhood of Thebes, but as late as the second

          conjectured that in ancient days the persons who wore the wreath of
          laurel or oak at the octennial festivals of Delphi and Thebes were
          no other than the priestly kings, who personated the god, slew
          their predecessors in the guise of dragons, and reigned for a time
          in their stead.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href=

          theory certainly cannot be demonstrated, but there is a good deal
          of analogy in its favour. An eight years' tenure of the kingship at
          Delphi and Thebes would accord with the similar tenure of the
          office at Sparta and Cnossus. And if the kings of Cnossus disguised
          themselves as bulls, there seems no reason why the kings of Delphi
          and Thebes should not have personated dragons or serpents. In all
          these cases the animal whose guise the king assumed would be sacred
          to the royal family. At first the relation of the beast to the man
          would be direct and simple; the creature would be revered for some
          such reason as that for which a savage respects a certain species
          of animals, for example, because he believes that his ancestors
          were beasts of the same sort, or that the souls of his dead are
          lodged in them. In later times the sanctity of the species would be
          explained by saying that a god had at some time, and for some
          reason or other, assumed the form of the animal. It is probably not
          without significance that in Greek mythology the gods in general,
          and Zeus in particular, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg
          083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          are commonly said to have submitted to this change of shape for the
          purpose of prosecuting a love adventure. Such stories may well
          reflect a custom of a Sacred Marriage at which the actors played
          the parts of the worshipful animals. With the growth of culture
          these local worships, the relics of a barbarous age, would be
          explained away by tales of the loves of the gods, and, gradually
          falling out of practice, would survive only as myths.</p>

          Their theory and practice would seem to have agreed with those of
          the Human Leopard Societies of western Africa, whose members
          disguise themselves in the skins of leopards with sharp claws of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hypothesis
          that the ancient kings of Thebes and Delphi had for their sacred
          animal the serpent or dragon, and claimed kinship with the
          creature, derives some countenance from the tradition that at the
          end of their lives Cadmus and his wife Harmonia quitted Thebes and
          went to reign over a tribe of Encheleans or Eel-men in Illyria,
          where they were both finally transformed into dragons or
          serpents.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href=

          can hardly, therefore, be an accident that the serpent-killer
          afterwards reigned over a tribe of eel-men and himself became a
          serpent at last. Moreover, according to one account, his wife
          Harmonia was a daughter of the very dragon which he slew.<a id=

          tradition would fit in well with the hypothesis that the dragon or
          serpent was the sacred animal of the old royal house of Thebes, and
          that the kingdom fell to him who slew his predecessor and married
          his daughter. We have seen reason to think that such a mode of
          succession to the throne was common in antiquity.<a id=

          story of the final transformation of Cadmus and Harmonia into

          tigers, and rhinoceroses, and that in their bestial form the dead

          during their lifetime kings in rude society sometimes claim kinship
          with the most formidable beasts of the country. Thus the royal
          family of Dahomey specially worships the leopard; some of the
          king's wives are distinguished by the title of Leopard Wives, and
          on state occasions they wear striped cloths to resemble the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the king's
          soul was believed to pass at death into the sacred animal, a custom
          might arise of keeping live creatures of the species in captivity
          and revering them as the souls of dead rulers. This would explain
          the Athenian practice of keeping a sacred serpent on the Acropolis
          and feeding it with honey cakes; for the serpent was identified
          with Erichthonius or Erechtheus, one of the ancient kings of
          Athens, of whose palace some vestiges have been discovered in
          recent times. The creature was supposed to guard the citadel.
          During the Persian invasion a report that the serpent had left its
          honey-cake untasted was one of the strongest reasons which induced
          the people to abandon Athens to the enemy; they thought that the

          have comprised a sacred marriage of these luminaries. The solar

          and that it was followed by a pageant representative of the
          nuptials of Cadmus and Harmonia in the presence of the gods. On
          this hypothesis Harmonia, the wife of Cadmus, is only another form
          of his sister Europa, both of them being personifications of the
          moon. Accordingly in the Samothracian mysteries, in which the
          marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia appears to have been celebrated, it
          was Harmonia and not Europa whose wanderings were dramatically

          octennial cycle. For it always fell on a full moon, at intervals of
          fifty and of forty-nine lunar months alternately.<a id=

          the total number of lunar months comprised in two successive

          Olympic games may, like the Pythian, have originally been
          celebrated at intervals of eight instead of four years. If that was
          so, analogy would lead us to infer that the festival was associated
          with a mythical marriage of the sun and moon. A reminiscence of
          such a marriage appears to survive in the legend that Endymion, the
          son of the first king of Elis, had fifty daughters by the Moon, and
          that he set his sons to run a race for the kingdom at
          Olympia.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> For,
          as scholars have already perceived, Endymion is the sunken sun
          overtaken by the moon below the horizon, and his fifty daughters by
          her are the fifty lunar months of an Olympiad or, more strictly
          speaking, of every alternate Olympiad.<a id="noteref_264" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a different
          and at first sight inconsistent explanation of the Olympic festival
          deserves to be considered. Some of the ancients held that all the
          great games of Greece—the Olympic, the Nemean, the Isthmian, and
          the Pythian—were funeral games celebrated in honour of the
          dead.<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href=

          great legendary hero, who had a sacred precinct at Olympia, where
          he was honoured above all the other heroes and received annually
          the sacrifice of a black ram.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277"
          href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a> Once
          a year, too, all the lads of Peloponnese are said to have lashed
          themselves on his grave at Olympia, till the blood streamed down
          their backs as a libation to the departed hero.<a id="noteref_278"

          Similarly at Roman funerals the women scratched their faces till
          they bled for the purpose, as Varro tells us, of pleasing the
          ghosts with the sight of the flowing blood.<a id="noteref_279"

          too, among the aborigines of Australia mourners sometimes cut and
          hack themselves and allow the streaming blood to drip on the dead
          body of their kinsman or into the grave.<a id="noteref_280" name=

          the eastern islanders of Torres Straits in like manner youths who
          had lately been initiated and girls who had attained to puberty
          used to have the lobes of their ears cut as a mourning ceremony,
          and the flowing blood was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg

          allowed to drip on the feet of the corpse as a mark of pity or
          sorrow; moreover, young adults of both sexes had patterns cut in
          their flesh with a sharp shell so that the blood fell on the dead
          body.<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href=

          similarity of these savage rites to the Greek custom observed at
          the grave of Pelops suggests that the tomb was not a mere cenotaph,
          but that it contained the actual remains of the dead hero, though
          these have not been discovered by the German excavators of Olympia.
          In like manner the Nemean games are said to have been celebrated in
          honour of the dead Opheltes, whose grave was shewn at Nemea.<a id=

          According to tradition, the Isthmian games were instituted in
          honour of the dead Melicertes, whose body had been washed ashore at
          the Isthmus of Corinth. It is said that when this happened a famine
          fell upon the Corinthians, and an oracle declared that the evil
          would not cease until the people paid due obsequies to the remains
          of the drowned Melicertes and honoured him with funeral games. The
          Corinthians complied with the injunction for a short time; but as
          soon as they omitted to celebrate the games, the famine broke out
          afresh, and the oracle informed them that the honours paid to
          Melicertes must be eternal.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283"

          wrestling, boxing, spear-throwing, quoit-throwing, and archery,
          were celebrated in honour of dead kings and heroes at their

          the theatre at Sparta there were two graves; one contained the
          bones of the gallant Leonidas which had been brought back from the
          pass of Thermopylae to rest in Spartan earth; the other held the
          dust of King Pausanias, who commanded the Greek armies on the great
          day when they routed the Persian host at Plataea, but who lived to
          tarnish his laurels and to die a traitor's death. Every year
          speeches were spoken over these graves and games were held in which
          none but Spartans might compete.<a id="noteref_287" name=

          Perhaps in the case of Pausanias the games were intended rather to
          avert his anger than to do him honour; for we are told that wizards
          were fetched even from Italy to lay the traitor's unquiet

          Again, when the Spartan general Brasidas, defending Amphipolis in
          Thrace against the Athenians, fell mortally wounded before the city
          and just lived, like Wolfe on the Heights of Abraham, to learn that
          his men were victorious, all the allies in arms followed the dead
          soldier to the grave; and the grateful citizens fenced his tomb
          about, sacrificed to him as a hero, and decreed that his memory
          should be honoured henceforth with games and annual

          benediction mingling with the sound of lamentations and sobs; and
          when at last the bier was laid on the pyre a herald chosen for his
          sonorous voice proclaimed that the people of Syracuse were burying
          Timoleon, and that they would honour him for all time to come with
          musical, equestrian, and athletic games, because he had put down
          the tyrants, conquered the foreign foe, rebuilt the cities that had

          men who had perished on the field of battle or been massacred in
          cold blood. When the Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians together had
          beaten the Phocaeans in a sea-fight, they landed their prisoners
          near Agylla in Etruria and stoned them all to death. After that,
          whenever the people of Agylla or their oxen or their sheep passed
          the scene of the massacre, they were attacked by a strange malady,
          which distorted their bodies and deprived them of the use of their
          limbs. So they consulted the Delphic oracle, and the priestess told
          them that they must offer great sacrifices to the dead Phocaeans

          doubt to appease the angry ghosts of the murdered men, who were

          the great battle with the Persians. Sacrifices were offered to them
          every year with great solemnity. The chief magistrate of Plataea,
          clad in a purple robe, washed with his own hands the tombstones and
          anointed them with scented oil. He slaughtered a black bull over a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that many different peoples have been in the habit of holding
          games, including horse-races, in honour of the dead; and as the
          ancient Greeks unquestionably did so within historical times for
          men whose existence is as little open to question as that of
          Wellington and Napoleon, we cannot dismiss as improbable the
          tradition that the Olympic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and perhaps other great Greek games were
          instituted to commemorate real men who once lived, died, and were
          buried on the spot where the festivals were afterwards held. When
          the person so commemorated had been great and powerful in his
          lifetime, his ghost would be deemed great and powerful after death,
          and the games celebrated in his honour might naturally attract
          crowds of spectators. The need of providing food and accommodation
          for the multitude which assembled on these occasions would in turn
          draw numbers of hucksters and merchants to the spot, and thus what
          in its origin had been a solemn religious ceremony might gradually
          assume more and more the character of a fair, that is, of a
          concourse of people brought together mainly for purposes of trade
          and amusement. This theory might account for the origin not only of
          the Olympic and other Greek games, but also for that of the great
          fairs or public assemblies of ancient Ireland which have been
          compared, not without reason, to the Greek games. Indeed the two
          most famous of these Irish festivals, in which horse-races played a
          prominent part, are actually said to have been instituted in honour
          of the dead. Most celebrated of all was the fair of Tailltiu or
          Tailltin, held at a place in the county of Meath which is now
          called Teltown on the Blackwater, midway between Navan and Kells.
          The festival lasted for a fortnight before Lammas (the first of
          August) and a fortnight after it. Among the manly sports and
          contests which formed a leading feature of the fair horse-races
          held the principal place. But trade was not neglected, and among
          the wares brought to market were marriageable women, who, according
          to a tradition which survived into the nineteenth century, were
          bought and sold as wives for one year. The very spot where the
          marriages took place is still pointed out by the peasantry; they
          call it <span class="tei tei-q">“Marriage Hollow.”</span>
          Multitudes flocked to the fair not only from all parts of Ireland,
          but even from Scotland; it is officially recorded that in the year
          1169 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> the horses and
          chariots alone, exclusive of the people on foot, extended in a
          continuous line for more than six English miles, from Tailltin to
          Mullach-Aiti, now the Hill of Lloyd near Kells. The Irish
          historians relate that the fair of Tailltin was instituted by Lug
          in honour of his foster-mother Tailltiu, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> whom he buried under a great sepulchral mound
          on the spot, ordering that a commemorative festival with games and
          sports should be celebrated there annually for ever.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> The
          other great fair of ancient Ireland was held only once in three
          years at Carman, now called Wexford, in Leinster. It began on
          Lammas Day (the first of August) and lasted six days. A horse-race
          took place on each day of the festival. In different parts of the
          green there were separate markets for victuals, for cattle and
          horses, and for gold and precious stuffs of the merchants. Harpers
          harped and pipers piped for the entertainment of the crowds, and in
          other parts of the fair bards recited in the ears of rapt listeners
          old romantic tales of forays and cattle-raids, of battles and
          murders, of love and courtship and marriage. Prizes were awarded to
          the best performers in every art. In the Book of Ballymote the fair
          of Carman or Garman is said to have been founded in accordance with
          the dying wish of a chief named Garman, who was buried on the spot,
          after begging that a fair of mourning (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aenach
          n-guba</span></span>) should be instituted for him and should bear
          his name for ever. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was considered an
          institution of great importance, and among the blessings promised
          to the men of Leinster from holding it and duly celebrating the
          established games, were plenty of corn, fruit and milk, abundance
          of fish in their lakes and rivers, domestic prosperity, and
          immunity from the yoke of any other province. On the other hand,
          the evils to follow from the neglect of this institution were to be
          failure and early greyness on them and their kings.”</span><a id=

          whether the tradition as to the funeral origin of these great Irish
          fairs is true or false, it is important to observe the date at
          which they were commonly celebrated. The date was the first of
          August, or Lugnasad, that is, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nasad</span></span> or games of Lug, as the

          well as of Tailltin and Carman. Now the first of August is our
          Lammas Day, a name derived from the Anglo-Saxon <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hlafmaesse</span></span>, that is,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Loaf-mass”</span> or <span class=

          mass or feast of thanksgiving for the first-fruits of the
          corn-harvest, which in England and Ireland usually ripen about that
          time. The feast <span class="tei tei-q">“seems to have been
          observed with bread of new wheat, and therefore in some parts of
          England, and even in some near Oxford, the tenants are bound to

          if the festival of the first of August was in its origin an
          offering of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg
          102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          first-fruits of the corn-harvest, we can easily understand the
          great importance which the ancient Irish attached to it, and why
          they should have thought that its observance ensured a plentiful
          crop of corn as well as abundance of fruit and milk and fish,
          whereas the neglect of the festival would entail the failure of
          these things and cause the hair of their kings to turn prematurely
          grey.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href=
          "#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> For
          it is a widespread custom among primitive agricultural peoples to
          offer the first-fruits of the harvest to divine beings, whether
          gods or spirits, before any person may eat of the new crops,<a id=
          "noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class=

          wherever such customs are observed we may assume that an omission
          to offer the first-fruits must be supposed to endanger the crops
          and the general prosperity of the community, by exciting the wrath
          of the gods or spirits, who conceive themselves to be robbed of
          their dues. Now among the divine beings who are thus propitiated
          the souls of dead ancestors take in many tribes a prominent or even
          exclusive place, and that these ancestors are not creations of the
          mythical fancy but were once men of flesh and blood is sometimes
          demonstrated by the substantial evidence of their skulls, to which
          the offerings are made and in which the spirits are supposed to
          take up their abode for the purpose of partaking of the food
          presented to them. Sometimes the ceremony is designated by the
          expressive name of <span class="tei tei-q">“feeding the
          dead.”</span><a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this tends
          to support the traditional explanation of the great Irish fairs
          held at the beginning of August, when the first corn is ripe; for
          if these festivals were indeed celebrated, as they are said to have
          been, at cemeteries where kings and other famous men were buried,
          and if the horse-races and other games, which formed the most
          prominent feature of the celebrations, were indeed instituted, as
          they are said to have been, in honour of dead men and women, we can
          perfectly understand why the observance of the festivals and the
          games was supposed to ensure a plentiful harvest and abundance of
          fruit and fish, whereas the neglect to celebrate them was believed
          to entail the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
          103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          failure of these things. So long as the spirits of the dead men and
          women, who were buried on the spot, received the homage of their
          descendants in the shape of funeral games and perhaps of
          first-fruits, so long would they bless their people with plenty by
          causing the earth to bring forth its fruits, the cows to yield
          milk, and the waters to swarm with fish; whereas if they deemed
          themselves slighted and neglected, they would avenge their wrongs
          by cutting off the food supply and afflicting the people with
          dearth and other calamities. Among these threatened calamities the
          premature greyness of the kings is specially mentioned, and was
          probably deemed not the least serious; for we have seen that the
          welfare of the whole people is often deemed to be bound up with the
          physical vigour of the king, and that the appearance of grey hairs
          on his head and wrinkles on his face is sometimes viewed with
          apprehension and proves the signal for putting him to death.<a id=

          Similarly the Abchases of the Caucasus imagine that if they do not
          honour a dead man by horse-races and other festivities, his ghost
          will be angry with them and visit his displeasure on their persons
          and their property.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> In
          this connexion it is significant that the celebration of the
          Isthmian games at Corinth in honour of the dead Melicertes is said
          to have been instituted for the purpose of staying a famine, and
          that the intermission of the games was immediately followed by a
          fresh visitation of the calamity.<a id="noteref_325" name=

          Analogy suggests that the famine may have been ascribed to the
          anger of the ghost of Melicertes at the neglect of his funeral
          honours.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus on the
          whole the theory of the funeral origin of the great Greek games is
          supported not only by Greek tradition and Greek custom but by the
          evidence of parallel customs observed in many lands. Yet the theory
          seems hardly adequate to explain all the features in the legends of
          the foundation and early history of the Olympic games. For if these
          contests were instituted merely to please and propitiate the soul
          of a prince named Pelops who was buried on the spot, what are we to
          make of the tradition that the foot-race was founded in order to
          determine the successor to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> or of
          the similar, though not identical, tradition that the kingdom and
          the hand of the king's daughter were awarded as the prize to him
          who could vanquish the king in a chariot race, while death was the
          penalty inflicted on the beaten charioteer?<a id="noteref_327"
          name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> Such
          legends can hardly have been pure fictions; they probably reflect
          some real custom observed at Olympia. We may perhaps combine them
          with the tradition of the funeral origin of the games by supposing
          that victory in the race entitled the winner to reign as a divine
          king, the embodiment of a god, for a term of years, whether four or
          eight years according to the interval between successive
          celebrations of the festival; that when the term had expired the
          human god must again submit his title to the crown to the hazard of
          a race for the purpose of proving that his bodily vigour was
          unimpaired; that if he failed to do so he lost both his kingdom and
          his life; and lastly that the spirits of these divine kings, like
          those of the divine kings of the Shilluk, were worshipped with
          sacrifices at their graves and were thought to delight in the
          spectacle of the games which reminded them of the laurels they had
          themselves won long ago, amid the plaudits of a vast multitude, in
          the sunshine and dust of the race-course, before they joined the
          shadowy company of ghosts in the darkness and silence of the tomb.
          The theory would explain the existence of the sacred precinct of
          Pelops at Olympia, where the black rams, the characteristic
          offerings to the dead,<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href=
          "#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> were
          sacrificed to the hero, and where the young men lashed themselves
          till the blood dripped from their backs on the ground—a sight
          well-pleasing to the grim bloodthirsty ghost lurking unseen below.
          Perhaps, too, the theory may explain the high mound, at some
          distance from Olympia, which passed for the grave of the suitors of
          Hippodamia, to whose shades Pelops is said to have sacrificed as to
          heroes every year.<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href=

          possible that the men buried in this great barrow were not, as
          tradition had it, the suitors who contended in the <span class=

          and being defeated were slain by her relentless father; they may
          have been men who, like Pelops himself, had won the kingdom and a
          bride in the chariot-race, and, after enjoying the regal dignity
          and posing as incarnate deities for a term of years, had been
          finally defeated in the race and put to death.</p>

          thought of these speculations, the great Olympic festival cannot

          fell, about halfway between the corn-reaping of early summer and
          the vintage of mid-autumn, alike exclude the supposition and alike
          point to an astronomical, not an agricultural, basis of the
          solemnity. Accordingly we seem driven to conclude that if the
          winners, male and female, in the Olympic games indeed represented
          divinities, these divinities must have been personifications of
          astronomical, not agricultural, powers; in short that the victors
          posed as embodiments of the Sun and Moon, then at the prime of
          their radiant power and glory, whose meeting in the heavenly

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the foregoing
          discussion it has been suggested that Delphi, Thebes, Salamis, and
          Athens were once ruled by kings who had, in modern language, a
          serpent or dragon for their crest, and were believed to migrate at
          death into the bodies of the beasts. But these legends of the
          dragon admit of another and, at first sight at least, discrepant
          explanation. It is difficult to separate them from those similar
          tales of the slaughter of a great dragon which are current in many
          lands, and have commonly been interpreted as nature-myths, in other
          words, as personifications of physical phenomena. Of such tales the
          oldest known versions are the ancient Babylonian and the ancient
          Indian. The Babylonian myth relates how in the beginning the mighty
          god Marduk fought and killed the great dragon Tiamat, an embodiment
          of the primaeval watery chaos, and how after his victory he created
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name=

          and earth by splitting the huge carcase of the monster into halves
          and setting one of them up to form the sky, while the other half
          apparently he used to fashion the earth. Thus the story is a myth
          of creation. In language which its authors doubtless understood
          literally, but which more advanced thinkers afterwards interpreted
          figuratively, it describes how confusion was reduced to order, how
          a cosmos emerged from chaos.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          Indian myth embodied in the hymns of the Rigveda tells how the
          strong and valiant god Indra conquered a great dragon or serpent
          named Vṛtra, which had obstructed the waters so that they could not
          flow. He slew the monster with his bolt, and then the pent-up
          springs gushed in rivers to the sea. And what he did once, he
          continues to do. Again and again he renews the conflict; again and
          again he slays the dragon and releases the imprisoned waters.
          Prayers are addressed to him that he would be pleased to do so in
          the future. Even priests on <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> earth sometimes associate themselves with
          Indra in his battles with the dragon. The worshipper is said to
          have placed the bolt in the god's hands, and the sacrifice is
          spoken of as having helped the weapon to slay the monster.<a id=
          "noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> Thus
          the feat attributed to Indra would seem to be a mythical account
          not so much of creation as of some regularly recurring phenomenon.
          It has been plausibly interpreted as a description of the bursting
          of the first storms of rain and thunder after the torrid heat of an
          Indian summer.<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href=
          "#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> At
          such times all nature, exhausted by the drought, longs for coolness
          and moisture. Day after day men and cattle may be tormented by the
          sight of clouds that gather and then pass away without disburdening
          themselves of their contents. At last the long-drawn struggle
          between the rival forces comes to a crisis. The sky darkens,
          thunder peals, lightning flashes, and the welcome rain descends in
          sheets, drenching the parched earth and flooding the rivers. Such a
          battle of the elements might well present itself to the primitive
          mind in the guise of a conflict between a maleficent dragon of
          drought and a beneficent god of thunder and rain. The cloud-dragon
          has swallowed the waters and keeps them shut up in the black coils
          of his sinuous body; the god cleaves the monster's belly with his
          thunder-bolt, and the imprisoned waters escape, in the form of
          dripping rain and rushing stream.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other
          countries a similar myth might, with appropriate variations of
          detail, express in like manner the passage of one season into
          another. For example, in more rigorous climates the dragon might
          stand for the dreary winter and the dragon-slayer for the genial
          summer. The myths of Apollo and the Python, of St. George and the
          Dragon have thus been interpreted as symbolising the victory of
          summer over winter.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href=

          Similarly it has been held with much probability that the
          Babylonian legend of Marduk and Tiamat reflects the annual change
          which transforms the valley of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class=

          wide Babylonian plain, flooded by the heavy rains, looks like a
          sea, for which the Babylonian word is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          when with the growing power of the sun the clouds vanish, the
          waters subside, and dry land and vegetation appear once more. On
          this hypothesis the dragon Tiamat represents the clouds, the rain,
          the floods of winter, while Marduk stands for the vernal or summer
          sun which dispels the powers of darkness and moisture.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the
          combat of Marduk and Tiamat was primarily a mythical description of
          the Babylonian spring, it would seem that its cosmogonical
          significance as an account of creation must have been an
          after-thought. The early philosophers who meditated on the origin
          of things may have pictured to themselves the creation or evolution
          of the world on the analogy of the great changes which outside the
          tropics pass over the face of nature every year. In these changes
          it is not hard to discern or to imagine a conflict between two
          hostile forces or principles, the principle of construction or of
          life and the principle of destruction or of death, victory
          inclining now to the one and now to the other, according as winter
          yields to spring or summer fades into autumn. It would be natural
          enough to suppose that the same mighty rivals which still wage war
          on each other had done so from the beginning, and that the
          formation of the universe as it now exists had resulted from the
          shock of their battle. On this theory the creation of the world is
          repeated every spring, and its dissolution is threatened every
          autumn: the one is proclaimed by summer's gay heralds, the opening
          flowers; the other is whispered by winter's sad harbingers, the
          yellow leaves. Here as elsewhere the old creed is echoed by the
          poet's fancy:—</p>

          if we would set ourselves at the point of view of the old sages who
          devised means so feeble to accomplish a purpose so immeasurably
          vast, we must divest ourselves of our modern conceptions of the
          immensity of the universe and of the pettiness and insignificance
          of man's place in it. We must imagine the infinitude of space
          shrunk to a few miles, the infinitude of time contracted to a few
          generations. To the savage the mountains that bound the visible
          horizon, or the sea that stretches away to meet it, is the world's
          end. Beyond these narrow limits his feet have never strayed, and
          even his imagination fails to conceive what lies across the waste
          of waters or the far blue hills. Of the future he hardly thinks,
          and of the past he knows only what has been handed down to him by
          word of mouth from his savage forefathers. To suppose that a world
          thus circumscribed in space and time was created by the efforts or
          the fiat of a being like himself imposes no great strain on his
          credulity; and he may without much difficulty imagine that he
          himself can annually repeat the work of creation by his charms and
          incantations. And once a horde of savages had instituted magical
          ceremonies for the renewal or preservation of all things, the force
          of custom and tradition would tend to maintain them in practice
          long after the old narrow ideas of the universe had been superseded
          by more adequate conceptions, and the tribe had expanded into a
          nation.</p>

          ever acted as a miracle-play or magical rite for the sake of
          bringing about those natural events which it describes in
          figurative language. But analogy leads us to conjecture that in

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> have been recited, if not acted, as an
          incantation, for the purpose I have indicated. At Babylon the
          recitation may have formed part of the great New Year festival of
          Marduk, which under the name of Zagmuk was celebrated with great
          pomp about the vernal equinox.<a id="noteref_337" name=

          this connexion it may not be without significance that one version
          of the Babylonian legend of creation has been found inscribed on a
          tablet, of which the reverse exhibits an incantation intended to be
          recited for the purification of the temple of E-zida in
          Borsippa.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> Now
          E-zida was the temple of Nabu or Nebo, a god closely associated, if
          not originally identical, with Marduk; indeed Hammurabi, the great
          king of Babylon, dedicated the temple in question to Marduk and not
          to Nabu.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href=

          seems not improbable, therefore, that the creation legend, in which
          Marduk played so important a part, was recited as an incantation at
          the purification of the temple E-zida. The ceremony perhaps took
          place at the Zagmuk festival, when the image of Nabu was solemnly
          brought in procession from his temple in Borsippa to the great
          temple of Marduk in Babylon.<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340"

          Moreover, it was believed that at this great festival the fates
          were determined by Marduk or Nabu for the ensuing year.<a id=

          the creation myth relates how, after he had slain the dragon,
          Marduk wrested the tablets of destiny from Ningu, the paramour of
          Tiamat, sealed them with a seal, and laid them on his breast.<a id=

          of the annual determination of the fates at Zagmuk. In short, it
          seems probable that the whole myth of creation was annually recited
          and acted at this great spring festival as a charm to dispel the
          storms and floods of winter, and to hasten the coming of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherever sacred
          dramas of this sort were acted as magical rites for the regulation
          of the seasons, it would be natural that the chief part should be
          played by the king, at first in his character of head magician, and
          afterwards as representative and embodiment of the beneficent god
          who vanquishes the powers of evil. If, therefore, the myth of the
          Slaughter of the Dragon was ever acted with this intention, the
          king would appropriately figure in the play as the victorious
          champion, while the defeated monster would be represented by an
          actor of inferior rank. But it is possible that under certain
          circumstances the distribution of parts in the drama might be
          somewhat different. Where the tenure of the regal office was
          limited to a fixed time, at the end of which the king was

          this latter sort would to a certain extent reconcile the two
          apparently discrepant interpretations of the myth which have been
          discussed in the preceding pages, and which for the sake of
          distinction may be called the totemic and the cosmological
          interpretations respectively. The serpent or dragon might be the
          sacred animal or totem of the royal house at the same time that it
          stood mythically for certain cosmological phenomena, whether
          moisture or drought, cold or heat, winter or summer. In like manner
          any other species of animal which served as the totem of the royal
          family might simultaneously possess a cosmological significance as
          the symbol of an elemental power. Thus at Cnossus, as we have seen
          reason to think, the bull was at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          sun. Similarly in Egypt the hawk was the symbol both of the sun and
          of the king. The oldest royal capital known to us was Hieraconpolis
          or Hawk-town, and the first Egyptian king of whom we hear had for
          his only royal title the name of hawk.<a id="noteref_344" name=

          the ground I am treading, and it is with great diffidence that I
          submit these speculations to the judgment of my readers. The
          subject of ancient mythology is involved in dense mists which it is
          not always possible to penetrate and illumine even with the lamp of
          the Comparative Method. Demonstration in such matters is rarely, if
          ever, attainable; the utmost that a candid enquirer can claim for
          his conclusions is a reasonable degree of probability. Future
          researches may clear up the obscurity which still rests on the myth
          of the Slaughter of the Dragon, and may thereby ascertain what
          measure of truth, if any, there is in the suggested

          respectively as the Ijebu Ode and the Ijebu Remon. The Ode branch
          of the tribe is ruled by a chief who bears the title of Awujale and
          is surrounded by a great deal of mystery. Down to recent times his
          face might not be seen even by his own subjects, and if
          circumstances obliged him to communicate with them he did so
          through a screen which hid him from view. The other or Remon branch

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Babylon,
          within historical times, the tenure of the kingly office was in
          practice lifelong, yet in theory it would seem to have been merely
          annual. For every year at the festival of Zagmuk the king had to
          renew his power by seizing the hands of the image of Marduk in his
          great temple of Esagil at Babylon. Even when Babylon passed under
          the power of Assyria, the monarchs of that country were expected to
          legalise their claim to the throne every year by coming to Babylon
          and performing the ancient ceremony at the New-year festival, and
          some of them found the obligation so burdensome that rather than
          discharge it they renounced the title of king altogether and
          contented themselves with the humbler one of Governor.<a id=

          Further, it would appear that in remote times, though not within
          the historical period, the kings of Babylon or their barbarous
          predecessors forfeited not merely their crown but their life at the
          end of a year's tenure of office. At least this is the conclusion
          to which the following evidence seems to point. According to the
          historian Berosus, who as a Babylonian priest spoke with ample
          knowledge, there was annually celebrated in Babylon a festival
          called the Sacaea. It began on the sixteenth day of the month Lous,
          and lasted for five days. During these five days masters and
          servants changed places, the servants giving orders and the masters
          obeying them. A <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg
          114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          prisoner condemned to death was dressed in the king's robes, seated
          on the king's throne, allowed to issue whatever commands he
          pleased, to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, and to lie with the
          king's concubines. But at the end of the five days he was stripped
          of his royal robes, scourged, and hanged or impaled. During his
          brief term of office he bore the title of Zoganes.<a id=
          "noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> This
          custom might perhaps have been explained as merely a grim jest
          perpetrated in a season of jollity at the expense of an unhappy
          criminal. But one circumstance—the leave given to the mock king to
          enjoy the king's concubines—is decisive against this
          interpretation. Considering the jealous seclusion of an oriental
          despot's harem we may be quite certain that permission to invade it
          would never have been granted by the despot, least of all to a
          condemned criminal, except for the very gravest cause. This cause
          could hardly be other than that the condemned man was about to die
          in the king's stead, and that to make the substitution perfect it
          was necessary he should enjoy the full rights of royalty during his
          brief reign. There is nothing surprising in this substitution. The
          rule that the king must be put to death either on the appearance of
          any symptom of bodily decay or at the end of a fixed period is
          certainly one which, sooner or later, the kings would seek to
          abolish or modify. We have seen that in Ethiopia, Sofala, and Eyeo
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name=
          "Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> rule was boldly set
          aside by enlightened monarchs; and that in Calicut the old custom
          of killing the king at the end of twelve years was changed into a
          permission granted to any one at the end of the twelve years'
          period to attack the king, and, in the event of killing him, to
          reign in his stead; though, as the king took care at these times to
          be surrounded by his guards, the permission was little more than a
          form. Another way of modifying the stern old rule is seen in the
          Babylonian custom just described. When the time drew near for the
          king to be put to death (in Babylon this appears to have been at
          the end of a single year's reign) he abdicated for a few days,
          during which a temporary king reigned and suffered in his stead. At
          first the temporary king may have been an innocent person, possibly
          a member of the king's own family; but with the growth of
          civilisation the sacrifice of an innocent person would be revolting
          to the public sentiment, and accordingly a condemned criminal would
          be invested with the brief and fatal sovereignty. In the sequel we
          shall find other examples of a dying criminal representing a dying
          god. For we must not forget that, as the case of the Shilluk kings
          clearly shews,<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href=
          "#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          king is slain in his character of a god or a demigod, his death and
          resurrection, as the only means of perpetuating the divine life
          unimpaired, being deemed necessary for the salvation of his people
          and the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If at Babylon
          before the dawn of history the king himself used to be slain at the
          festival of the Sacaea, it is natural to suppose that the Sacaea
          was no other than Zagmuk or Zakmuk, the great New-year festival at
          which down to historical times the king's power had to be formally
          renewed by a religious ceremony in the temple of Marduk. The theory
          of the identity of the festivals is indeed strongly supported by
          many considerations and has been accepted by some eminent
          scholars,<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href=

          it has to encounter a serious chronological difficulty, since
          Zagmuk fell about the equinox <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Berosus was held on the sixteenth of the month Lous, which was the
          tenth month of the Syro-Macedonian calendar and appears to have
          nearly coincided with July. The question of the sameness or

          it is to be observed that Zagmuk was apparently celebrated in
          Assyria as well as in Babylonia. For at the end of his great
          inscription Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, expresses a wish that it
          may be granted to him to muster all his riding-horses and so forth
          every year at Zagmuk in his palace.<a id="noteref_353" name=

          whether the power of the Assyrian kings had, like that of the
          Babylonian monarchs, to be annually renewed at this festival, we do
          not know. However, a trace of an annual tenure of the kingly office
          in Assyria may perhaps, as Dr. C. Brockelmann thinks,<a id=

          detected in the rule that an Assyrian king regularly gave his name
          only to a single year of his reign, while all the other years were
          named after certain officers and provincial governors, about thirty
          in number, who were appointed for this purpose and succeeded each

          appears to have survived in the festival called Macahity, which
          used to be celebrated in Hawaii during the last month of the year.
          About a hundred years ago a Russian voyager described the custom as
          follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The taboo Macahity is not unlike
          to our festival of Christmas. It continues a whole month, during
          which the people amuse themselves with dances, plays, and
          sham-fights <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
          118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of every kind. The king must open this festival wherever he is. On
          this occasion his majesty dresses himself in his richest cloak and
          helmet, and is paddled in a canoe along the shore, followed
          sometimes by many of his subjects. He embarks early, and must
          finish his excursion at sun-rise. The strongest and most expert of
          the warriors is chosen to receive him on his landing. This warrior
          watches the canoe along the beach; and as soon as the king lands,
          and has thrown off his cloak, he darts his spear at him, from a
          distance of about thirty paces, and the king must either catch the
          spear in his hand, or suffer from it: there is no jesting in the
          business. Having caught it, he carries it under his arm, with the
          sharp end downwards, into the temple or heavoo. On his entrance,
          the assembled multitude begin their sham-fights, and immediately
          the air is obscured by clouds of spears, made for the occasion with

          catch a spear as any one on the island is to throw it at him.
          During the Macahity, all punishments are remitted throughout the

        putting kings to death at the end of a set term has prevailed in many

        in tradition long after the custom itself has been abolished. In the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">High
        History of the Holy Graal</span></span> we read how Lancelot roamed
        through strange lands and forests seeking adventures till he came to
        a fair and wide plain lying without a city that seemed of right great
        lordship. As he rode across the plain the people came forth from the
        city to welcome him with the sound of flutes and viols and many
        instruments of music. When he asked them what meant all this joy,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Sir,’</span> said
        they, <span class="tei tei-q">‘all this joy is made along of you, and
        all these instruments of music are moved to joy and sound of gladness
        for your coming.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘But wherefore for
        me?’</span> saith Lancelot. <span class="tei tei-q">‘That shall you
        know well betimes,’</span> say they. <span class="tei tei-q">‘This
        city began to burn and to melt in one of the houses from the very
        same hour that our king was dead, nor might the fire be quenched, nor
        ever will be quenched until such time as we have a king that shall be
        lord of the city and of the honour thereunto belonging, and on New
        Year's Day behoveth him to be crowned in the midst of the fire, and
        then shall the fire be quenched, for otherwise may it never be put
        out nor extinguished. Wherefore have we come to meet you to give you
        the royalty, for we have been told that you are a good
        knight.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lords,’</span> saith
        Lancelot, <span class="tei tei-q">‘of such a kingdom have I no need,
        and God defend me from it.’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Sir,’</span> say they, <span class="tei tei-q">‘you may
        not be defended thereof, for you come into this land at hazard, and

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121"

        by the default of one single man, and the lordship is right great,
        and this will be right great worship to yourself, that on New Year's
        Day you should be crowned in the fire and thus save this city and
        this great people, and thereof shall you have great praise.’</span>
        Much marvelleth Lancelot of this that they say. They come round about
        him on all sides and lead him into the city. The ladies and damsels
        are mounted to the windows of the great houses and make great joy,
        and say the one to another, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Look at the new
        king here that they are leading in. Now will he quench the fire on
        New Year's Day.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord!’</span> say
        the most part, <span class="tei tei-q">‘what great pity is it of so
        comely a knight that he shall end on such-wise!’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Be still!’</span> say the others. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Rather should there be great joy that so fair city as is
        this should be saved by his death, for prayer will be made throughout
        all the kingdom for his soul for ever!’</span> Therewith they lead
        him to the palace with right great joy and say that they will crown
        him. Lancelot found the palace all strown with rushes and hung about
        with curtains of rich cloths of silk, and the lords of the city all
        apparelled to do him homage. But he refuseth right stoutly, and saith
        that their king nor their lord will he never be in no such sort.
        Thereupon behold you a dwarf that entereth into the city, leading one
        of the fairest dames that be in any kingdom, and asketh whereof this
        joy and this murmuring may be. They tell him they are fain to make
        the knight king, but that he is not minded to allow them, and they
        tell him the whole manner of the fire. The dwarf and the damsel are
        alighted, then they mount up to the palace. The dwarf calleth the
        provosts of the city and the greater lords. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Lords,’</span> saith he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘sith
        that this knight is not willing to be king, I will be so willingly,
        and I will govern the city at your pleasure and do whatsoever you
        have devised to do.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘In faith, sith
        that the knight refuseth this honour and you desire to have it,
        willingly will we grant it you, and he may go his way and his road,
        for herein do we declare him wholly quit.’</span> Therewithal they
        set the crown on the dwarf's head, and Lancelot maketh great joy
        thereof. He taketh his leave, and they commend him to God, and so
        remounteth he on his horse and goeth his way through the midst of the
        city <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A story of the

        Tradition has it that once on a time an arch-fiend, with a legion of
        devils at his command, took up his abode in Ujjain, the inhabitants
        of which he vexed and devoured. Many had fallen a prey to him, and
        others had abandoned the country to save their lives. The once
        populous city was fast being converted into a desert. At last the
        principal citizens, meeting in council, besought the fiend to reduce
        his rations to one man a day, who would be duly delivered up to him
        in order that the rest might enjoy a day's repose. The demon closed
        with the offer, but required that the man whose turn it was to be
        sacrificed should mount the throne and exercise the royal power for a
        single day, all the grandees of the kingdom submitting to his
        commands, and everybody yielding him the most absolute obedience.
        Necessity obliged the citizens to accept these hard terms; their
        names were entered on a list; every day one of them in his turn ruled
        from morning to night, and was then devoured by the demon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it happened by
        great good luck that a caravan of merchants from Gujerat halted on
        the banks of a river not far from the city. They were attended by a
        servant who was no other than Vikramaditya. At nightfall the jackals
        began to howl as usual, and one of them said in his own tongue,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“In two hours a human corpse will shortly
        float down this river, with four rubies of great price at his belt,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123"

        finger. He who will give me that corpse to devour will bear sway over
        the seven lands.”</span> Vikramaditya, knowing the language of birds
        and beasts, understood what the jackal said, gave the corpse to the
        beast to devour, and took possession of the ring and the rubies. Next
        day he entered the town, and, traversing the streets, observed a
        troop of horse under arms, forming a royal escort, at the door of a
        potter's house. The grandees of the city were there, and with them
        was the garrison. They were in the act of inducing the son of the
        potter to mount an elephant and proceed in state to the palace. But
        strange to say, instead of being pleased at the honour conferred on
        their son, the potter and his wife stood on the threshold weeping and
        sobbing most bitterly. Learning how things stood, the chivalrous
        Vikramaditya was touched with pity, and offered to accept the fatal
        sovereignty instead of the potter's son, saying that he would either
        deliver the people from the tyranny of the demon or perish in the
        attempt. Accordingly he donned the kingly robes, assumed all the
        badges of sovereignty, and, mounting the elephant, rode in great pomp
        to the palace, where he seated himself on the throne, while the
        dignitaries of the kingdom discharged their duties in his presence.
        At night the fiend arrived as usual to eat him up. But Vikramaditya
        was more than a match for him, and after a terrific combat the fiend
        capitulated and agreed to quit the city. Next morning the people on
        coming to the palace were astonished to find Vikramaditya still
        alive. They thought he must be no common mortal, but some superhuman
        being, or the descendant of a great king. Grateful to him for their
        deliverance they bestowed the kingdom on him, and he reigned happily
        over them.<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to one
        account, the dreadful being who ravaged Ujjain and devoured a king
        every day was the bloodthirsty goddess Kali. When she quitted the
        city she left behind her two sisters, whose quaint images still frown
        on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name=
        "Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the spectator from the
        pillared portal known as Vikramaditya's Gate at Ujjain. To these her
        sisters she granted the privilege of devouring as many human beings
        as they pleased once every twelve years. That tribute they still
        exact, though the European in his blindness attributes the deaths to
        cholera. But in addition seven girls and five buffaloes were to be
        sacrificed to them every year, and these sacrifices used to be
        offered regularly until the practice was put down by the English
        Government. It is said that the men who gave their five-year-old
        daughters to be slain received grants of land as a reward of their
        piety. Nowadays only buffaloes are killed at the Daçaratha festival,
        which is held in October on the ninth day of the month Açvina. The
        heads of the animals are buried at Vikramaditya's gateway, and those
        of the last year's victims are taken up. The girls who would formerly
        have been sacrificed are now released, but they are not allowed to
        marry, and their fathers still receive grants of lands just as if the
        cruel sacrifice had been consummated.<a id="noteref_364" name=

        to consider another of the stories which are told of King
        Vikramaditya. His birth is said to have been miraculous, for his
        father was Gandharva-Sena, who was the son of the great god Indra.
        One day Gandharva-Sena had the misfortune to offend his divine
        father, who was so angry that he cursed his son and banished him from
        heaven to earth, there to remain under the form of an ass by day and
        of a man by night until a powerful king should burn his ass's body,
        after which Gandharva-Sena would regain his proper shape and return
        to the upper world. All this happened according to the divine word.
        In the shape of an ass the son of the god rendered an important
        service to the King of Dhara, and received the hand of the king's
        daughter as his reward. By day he was an ass and ate hay <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the stables; by night he was a man and
        enjoyed the company of the princess his wife. But the king grew tired
        of the taunts of his enemies, as well as of the gibes which were
        levelled by unfeeling wits at his asinine son-in-law. So one night,
        while Gandharva-Sena in human shape was with his wife, the king got
        hold of the ass's body which his son-in-law had temporarily quitted,
        and throwing it on a fire burned it to ashes. On the instant
        Gandharva-Sena appeared to him, and thanking him for undoing the
        spell announced that he was about to return to heaven, but that his
        wife was with child by him, and that she would bring forth a son who
        would bear the name of Vikramaditya and be endowed with the strength
        of a thousand elephants. The deserted wife was filled with sorrow at
        his departure, and died in giving birth to Vikramaditya.<a id=

            to animals which temporarily assume human form.</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This story belongs
        to a widely diffused type of tale which in England is known by the
        name of Beauty and the Beast. It relates how a beast, doffing its
        animal shape, lives as a human husband or wife with a human spouse.
        Often, though not always, their marriage has a tragic ending. The
        couple live lovingly together for years and children are born to
        them. But it is a condition of their union that the transformed
        husband or wife should never be reminded of his or her old life in
        furry, feathered, or finny form. At last one unhappy day the fairy
        spouse finds his or her beast skin, which had been carefully hidden
        away by her or his loving partner; or husband and wife quarrel and
        the real man or woman taunts the other with her or his kinship with
        the beasts. The sight of the once familiar skin awakens old memories
        and stirs yearnings that had been long suppressed: the cruel words
        undo the kindness of years. The sometime animal resumes its native
        shape and disappears, and the human husband or wife is left
        lamenting. Sometimes, as in the story of Gandharva-Sena, the
        destruction of the beast's skin causes the fairy mate to vanish for
        ever; sometimes it enables him or her to remain thenceforth in human
        form <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name=
        "Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with the human wife or
        husband. Tales of this sort are told by savages in many parts of the
        world, and many of them have survived in the folk-lore of civilised
        peoples. With their implied belief that beasts can turn into men or
        men into beasts, they must clearly have originated among savages who
        see nothing incredible in such transformations.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is to be
        observed that stories of this sort are told by savage tribes to
        explain why they abstain from eating certain creatures. The reason
        they assign for the abstinence is that they themselves are descended
        from a creature of that sort, who was changed for a time into human
        shape and married a human husband or wife. Thus in the rivers of
        Sarawak there is a certain fish called a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">puttin</span></span>, which some of the Dyaks
        will on no account eat, saying that if they did so they would be
        eating their relations. Tradition runs that a solitary old man went
        out fishing and caught a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">puttin</span></span>, which he dragged out of
        the water and laid down in his boat. On turning round he perceived
        that it had changed into a very pretty girl. He thought she would
        make a charming wife for his son, so he took her home and brought her
        up till she was of an age to marry. She consented to be his son's
        wife, but cautioned her husband to use her well. Some time after
        marriage, however, he was angry and struck her. She screamed and
        rushed away into the water, leaving behind her a beautiful daughter
        who became the mother of the race. Other Dyak tribes tell similar
        stories of their ancestors.<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366"
        href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> Thus
        the Sea Dyaks relate how the white-headed hawk married a Sea Dyak
        woman, and how he gave all his daughters in marriage to the various
        omen-birds. Hence if a Sea Dyak kills an omen-bird by mistake, he
        wraps it in a cloth and buries it carefully in the earth along with
        rice, flesh, and money, entreating the bird not to be vexed, and to
        forgive him, because it was all an accident.<a id="noteref_367" name=

            It describes how the young chief Siu married a woman of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sea Dyaks also
        tell a story of the same sort to explain how they first came to plant
        rice and to revere the omen-birds which play so important a part in
        Dyak life. Long, long ago, so runs the tale, when rice was yet
        unknown, and the Dyaks lived on tapioca, yams, potatoes, and such
        fruits as they could procure, a handsome young chief named Siu went
        out into the forest with his blow-pipe to shoot birds. He wandered
        without seeing a bird or meeting an animal till the sun was sinking
        in the west. Then he came to a wild fig-tree covered with ripe fruit,
        which a swarm of birds of all kinds were busy pecking at. Never in
        his life had he seen so many birds together! It seemed as if all the
        fowls of the forest were gathered in the boughs of that tree. He
        killed a great many with the poisoned darts of his blow-pipe, and
        putting them in his basket started for home. But he lost his way in
        the wood, and the night had fallen before he saw the lights and heard
        the usual sounds of a Dyak house. Hiding his blow-pipe and the dead
        birds in the jungle, he went up the ladder into the house, but what
        was his surprise to find it apparently deserted. There was no one in
        the long verandah, and of the people whose voices he had heard a
        minute before not one was to be seen. Only in one of the many rooms,
        dimly lighted, he found a beautiful girl, who prepared for him his
        evening meal. Now though Siu did not know it, the house was the house
        of the great Singalang Burong, the Ruler of the Spirit World. He
        could turn himself and his followers into any shape. When they went
        forth against an enemy they took the form of birds for the sake of
        speed, and flew over the tall trees, the broad rivers, and even the
        sea. But in his own house and among his own people Singalang Burong
        appeared as a man. He had eight daughters, and the girl who cooked
        Siu's food for him was the youngest. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> reason why the house was so still and deserted
        was that the people were in mourning for some of their relatives who
        had just been killed, and the men had gone out to take human heads in
        revenge. Siu stayed in the house for a week, and then the girl, whose
        pet name was Bunsu Burong or <span class="tei tei-q">“the youngest of
        the bird family,”</span> agreed to marry him; but she said he must
        promise never to kill or hurt a bird or even to hold one in his
        hands; for if he did, she would be his wife no more. Siu promised,
        and together they returned to his people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There they lived
        happily, and in time Siu's wife bore him a son whom they named
        Seragunting. One day when the boy had grown wonderfully tall and
        strong for his years and was playing with his fellows, a man brought
        some birds which he had caught in a trap. Forgetting the promise he
        had made to his wife, Siu asked the man to shew him the birds, and
        taking one of them in his hand he stroked it. His wife saw it and was
        sad at heart. She took the pitchers and went as though she would
        fetch water from the well. But she never came back. Siu and his son
        sought her, sorrowing, for days. At last after many adventures they
        came to the house of the boy's grandfather, Singalang Burong, the
        Ruler of the Spirit World. There they found the lost wife and mother,
        and there they stayed for a time. But the heart of Siu yearned to his
        old home. He would fain have persuaded his wife to return with him,
        but she would not. So at last he and his son went back alone. But
        before he went he learned from his father-in-law how to plant rice,
        and how to revere the sacred birds and to draw omens from them. These
        birds were named after the sons-in-law of the Ruler of the Spirit
        World and were the appointed means whereby he made known his wishes
        to mankind. That is how the Sea Dyaks learned to plant rice and to
        honour the omen-birds.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href=

        divided into a number of great families or clans, mostly named after
        animals or plants, and the members of a clan refrain from eating
        animals of the species whose name they bear. In short, the various
        animals or plants are the totems of their respective clans. Now some
        of the more recent of these clans possess traditions of their origin,
        and in such cases the founder of the family, from whom the name is
        derived, is always represented as having been a beast, bird, or fish,
        which possessed the power of assuming human shape at will. Thus, for
        instance, at the town of Chama there resides a family or clan who
        take their name from the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sarfu</span></span> or horse-mackerel, which
        they may not eat because they are descended from a horse-mackerel.
        One day, so runs the story, a native of Chama who had lost his wife
        was walking sadly on the beach, when he met a beautiful young woman
        whom he persuaded to be his wife. She consented, but told him that
        her home lay in the sea, that her people were fishes, and that she
        herself was a fish, and she made him swear that he would never allude
        to her old home and kinsfolk. All went well for a time till her
        husband took a second wife, who quarrelled with the first wife and
        taunted her with being a fish. That grieved her so that she bade her
        husband good-bye and plunged into the sea with her youngest child in
        her arms. But she left her two elder children behind, and from them
        are descended the Horse-mackerel people of Chama. A similar story is
        told of another family in the town of Appam. Their ancestor caught a
        fine fish of the sort called <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">appei</span></span>, which turned into a
        beautiful woman and became his wife. But she told him that in future
        neither they nor their descendants might eat the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">appei</span></span> fish or else they would at
        once return to the sea. The family, duly observing the prohibition,
        increased and multiplied till they occupied the whole country, which
        was named after them Appeim or Appam.<a id="noteref_370" name=

            <span style="font-size: 80%">Stories of this sort were probably
            at first always told to explain the totemic belief in the kinship
            of certain families with certain species of animals. When husband
            and wife had different totems, a violation of the totemic taboos
            by husband or wife might lead to the separation of the spouses.
            This would explain the separation of husband and wife in the type
            of tale here discussed.</span>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may surmise
        that stories of this sort, wherever found, had a similar origin; in
        other words, that they reflect and are intended to explain a real
        belief in the kinship of certain families with certain species of
        animals. Hence if the name <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg
        130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        totemism may be used to include all such beliefs and the practices
        based on them, the origin of this type of story may be said to be
        totemic.<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href=
        "#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> Now,
        wherever the totemic clans have become exogamous, that is, wherever a
        man is always obliged to marry a woman of a totem different from his
        own, it is obvious that husband and wife will always have to observe
        different totemic taboos, and that a want of respect shewn by one of
        them for the sacred animal or plant of the other would tend to
        domestic jars, which might often lead to the permanent separation of
        the spouses, the offended wife or husband returning to her or his
        native clan of the fish-people, the bird-people, or what not. That, I
        take it, was the origin of the sad story of the man or woman happily
        mated with a transformed animal and then parted for ever. Such tales,
        if I am right, were not wholly fictitious. Totemism may have broken
        many loving hearts. But when that ancient <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> system of society had fallen into disuse, and
        the ideas on which it was based had ceased to be understood, the
        quaint stories of mixed marriages to which it had given birth would
        not be at once forgotten. They would continue to be told, no longer
        indeed as myths explanatory of custom, but merely as fairy tales for
        the amusement of the listeners. The barbarous features of the old
        legends, which now appeared too monstrously incredible even for
        story-tellers, would be gradually discarded and replaced by others
        which fitted in better with the changed beliefs of the time. Thus in
        particular the animal husband or animal wife of the story might drop
        the character of a beast to assume that of a fairy. This is the stage
        of decay exhibited by the two most famous tales of the class in
        question, the Greek fable of Cupid and Psyche and the Indian story of
        King Pururavas and the nymph Urvasi, though in the latter we can
        still detect hints that the fairy wife was once a bird-woman.<a id=

        tribe and nation to nation, till they may be handed down by oral
        tradition among people who neither practise nor even understand the
        customs in which the stories originated. Yet the legend of the
        miraculous parentage of Vikramaditya may very well have been based on
        the existence at Ujjain of a line of rajahs who had the ass for their
        crest or totem.<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href=
        "#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a> Such a
        custom is not without analogy in India. The crest of the Maharajah of
        Nagpur is a cobra with a human face under its expanded hood,
        surrounded by all the insignia of royalty. Moreover, the Rajah and
        the chief members of his family always wear turbans so arranged that
        they resemble a coiled serpent with its head projecting over the
        wearer's brow. To explain this serpent badge a tale is told which
        conforms to the type of Beauty and the Beast. Once upon a time a Nag
        or serpent named Pundarika took upon himself the likeness of a
        Brahman, and repaired in that guise to the house of a real Brahman at
        Benares, in order to perfect himself in a knowledge of the sacred
        books. The teacher was so pleased with the progress made by his pupil
        that he gave him his only child, the beautiful Parvati, to wife. But
        the subtle serpent, though he could assume any form at pleasure, was
        unable to rid himself of his forked tongue and foul breath. To
        conceal these personal blemishes from his wife he always slept with
        his back to her. One night, however, she got round him and discovered
        his unpleasant peculiarities. She questioned him sharply, and to
        divert her attention he proposed that they should make a pilgrimage
        to Juggernaut. The idea of visiting that fashionable watering-place
        so raised the lady's spirits that she quite forgot to pursue the
        enquiry. However, on their way home her curiosity revived, and she
        repeated her questions under circumstances which rendered it
        impossible for the serpent, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg
        133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as
        a tender husband, to evade them, though well he knew that the
        disclosure he was about to make would sever him, the immortal, at
        once and for ever from his mortal wife. He related the wondrous tale,
        and, plunging into a pool, disappeared from sight. His poor wife was
        inconsolable at his hurried departure, and in the midst of her grief
        and remorse her child was born. But instead of rejoicing at the
        birth, she made for herself a funeral pyre and perished in the
        flames. At that moment a Brahman appeared on the scene, and perceived
        the forsaken babe lying sheltered and guarded by a great hooded
        snake. It was the serpent father protecting his child. Addressing the
        Brahman, he narrated his history, and foretold that the child should
        be called Phani-Makuta Raya, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        snake crowned,”</span> and that he should reign as rajah over the
        country to be called Nagpur. That is why the rajahs of Nagpur have
        the serpent for their crest.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374"

        the rajahs of Manipur trace their descent from a divine snake. At his
        installation a rajah of Manipur used to have to pass with great
        solemnity between two massive dragons of stone which stood in front
        of the coronation house. Somewhere inside the building was a
        mysterious chamber, and in the chamber was a pipe, which, according
        to the popular belief, led down to the depths of a cavern where
        dwells the snake god, the ancestor of the royal family. The length
        and prosperity of the rajah's reign were believed to depend on the
        length of time he could sit on the pipe enduring the fiery breath of
        his serpentine forefather in the place below. Women are specially
        devoted to the worship of the ancestral snake, and great reverence is

            the Beast are not mere fictions, but rest on a real basis of
            belief and custom. Similarly the legend of kings who were
            sacrificed after a reign of a single day has its analogy in
            actual custom. Such stories indicate that the supply of kings may
            have been maintained by compelling men to accept the fatal

        foregoing sort might be dismissed as fictions designed to amuse a
        leisure hour, were it not for their remarkable agreement with beliefs
        and customs which, as we have seen, still exist, or are known to have
        existed in former times. That agreement can hardly be accidental. We
        seem to be justified, therefore, in assuming that stories of the kind
        really rest on a basis of facts, however much these facts may have
        been distorted or magnified in passing through the mind of the
        story-teller, who is naturally more concerned to amuse than instruct
        his hearers. Even the legend of a line of kings of whom each reigned
        for a single day, and was sacrificed at night for the good of the
        people, will hardly seem incredible when we remember that to this day
        a kingdom is held on a similar tenure in west Africa, though under
        modern conditions the throne stands vacant.<a id="noteref_376" name=

        while it would be vain to rely on such stories for exact historical
        details, yet they may help us in a general way to understand the
        practical working of an institution which to civilised men seems at
        first sight to belong to the cloudland of fancy rather than to the
        sober reality of the workaday world. Remark, for example, how in
        these stories the supply of kings is maintained. In the Indian
        tradition all the men of the city are put on a list, and each of
        them, when his turn comes, is forced to reign for a day and to die
        the death. It is not left to his choice to decide whether he will
        accept the fatal sovereignty or not. In the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">High History of the
        Holy Grail</span></span> the mode of filling the vacant <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> throne is different. A stranger, not a
        citizen, is seized and compelled to accept office. In the end, no
        doubt, the dwarf volunteers to be king, thus saving Lancelot's life;
        but the narrative plainly implies that if a substitute had not thus
        been found, Lancelot would have been obliged, whether he would or
        not, to wear the crown and to perish in the fire.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In thus
        representing the succession to a throne as compulsory, the stories
        may well preserve a reminiscence of a real custom. To us, indeed, who
        draw our ideas of kingship from the hereditary and highly privileged
        monarchies of civilised Europe, the notion of thrusting the crown
        upon reluctant strangers or common citizens of the lowest rank is apt
        to appear fantastic and absurd. But that is merely because we fail to
        realise how widely the modern type of kingship has diverged from the
        ancient pattern. In early times the duties of sovereignty are more
        conspicuous than its privileges. At a certain stage of development
        the chief or king is rather the minister or servant than the ruler of
        his people. The sacred functions which he is expected to discharge
        are deemed essential to the welfare, and even the existence, of the
        community, and at any cost some one must be found to perform them.
        Yet the burdens and restrictions of all sorts incidental to the early
        kingship are such that not merely in popular tales, but in actual
        practice, compulsion has sometimes been found necessary to fill
        vacancies, while elsewhere the lack of candidates has caused the
        office to fall into abeyance, or even to be abolished
        altogether.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href=

        A variety of causes has led the modern nations of western Europe to
        set on human life—their own life and that of others—a higher value
        than is put upon it by many other races. The result is a fear of
        death which is certainly not shared in the same <span class=

        the spread of luxury and the doctrines of a gloomy theology, which by
        proclaiming the eternal damnation and excruciating torments of the
        vast majority of mankind has added incalculably to the dread and
        horror of death. The growth of humaner sentiments, which seldom fails
        to effect a corresponding amelioration in the character even of the
        gods, has indeed led many Protestant divines of late years to temper
        the rigour of the divine justice with a large infusion of mercy by
        relegating the fires of hell to a decent obscurity or even

        examples must here suffice. Speaking of the natives of India an
        English writer observes: <span class="tei tei-q">“We place the
        highest value on life, while they, being blessed with a comfortable
        fatalism, which assumes that each man's destiny is written on his
        forehead in invisible characters, and being besides untroubled with
        any doubts or thoughts as to the nature of their reception in the
        next world, take matters of life and death a great deal more
        unconcernedly, and, compared with our ideas, they may be said to
        present an almost apathetic indifference on these
        subjects.”</span><a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href=
        "#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        same effect another English writer remarks that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the absence of that fear of death, which is so powerful
        in the hearts of civilised men, is the most remarkable trait in the
        Hindu character.”</span><a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href=

        the natives of Annam, according to a Catholic missionary,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the subject of death has nothing alarming
        for anybody. In presence of a sick man people will speak of his
        approaching end <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg
        137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        of his funeral as readily as of anything else. Hence we never need to
        take the least verbal precaution in warning the sick to prepare
        themselves to receive the last sacraments. Some time ago I was
        summoned to a neophyte whose death, though certain, was still
        distant. On entering the house I found a woman seated at his bedside
        sewing the mourning dresses of the family. Moreover, the carpenter
        was fitting together the boards of the coffin quite close to the door
        of the house, so that the dying man could observe the whole
        proceeding from his bed. The worthy man superintended personally all
        these details and gave directions for each of the operations. He even
        had for his pillow part of the mourning costume which was already
        finished. I could tell you a host of anecdotes of the same
        sort.”</span> Among these people it is a mark of filial piety to
        present a father or mother with a coffin; the presentation is the
        occasion of a family festival to which all friends are invited.
        Pupils display their respect for their masters in the same fashion.
        Bishop Masson, whose letter I have just quoted, was himself presented
        with a fine coffin by some of his converts as a New Year gift and a
        token of their respect and affection; they invited his attention
        particularly to the quality of the wood and the beauty of the
        workmanship.<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href=

        of my residence and travels in the Indian country, I never knew and

        reappearance of the body in a future state. However mistaken they are
        on the subject of accountabilities for acts done in the present life,
        no small part of their entire mythology, and the belief that sustains
        the man in his vicissitudes and wanderings here, arises from the
        anticipation of ease and enjoyment in a future condition, after the

        to escape; but once they are seized and bound, they resign themselves

        died and was about to be lowered into the earth, his favourites and
        servants used to compete with each other for the privilege of being
        buried alive with his body in order that they might attend and
        minister to him in the other world. After the dispute was settled and
        the tomb had closed over the dead and the living, sentinels were set
        to watch it day and night. Next day the sepulchre would be opened and
        some one would call down to the entombed men to know what they were
        doing and whether any of them had gone to serve the king. The answer
        was commonly, <span class="tei tei-q">“No, not yet.”</span> The third
        day the same question would be put, and a voice would reply that

        the happiest. In four or five days when no answer came up to the
        question, and all was silent in the grave, the heir to the throne was
        informed, and he signalised his accession by kindling a fire on the
        tomb, roasting flesh at it, and distributing the meat to the
        people.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href=

        daughter of a Mbaya chief in South America, having been happily
        baptized at the very point of death, was accorded Christian burial in
        the church by the Jesuit missionary who had rescued her like a brand
        from the burning. But an old heathen woman of the tribe took it sadly
        to heart that her chief's daughter should not be honoured with the
        usual human sacrifices. So, drawing an Indian aside, she implored him
        to be so kind as to knock her on the head, that she might go and
        serve her young mistress in the Land of Souls. The savage obligingly
        complied with her request, and the whole horde begged the missionary
        that her body might be buried with that of the chief's daughter. The
        Jesuit sternly refused. He informed them that the girl was now with
        the angels, and stood in need of no such attendant. As for the old
        woman, he observed grimly that she had gone to a very different place
        and would move in a very different circle of society.<a id=

        some peoples etiquette requires that if a man commits suicide for
        this purpose, his enemy should at once follow his example. To take a
        single example. There is a caste of robbers in southern India among
        whom <span class="tei tei-q">“the law of retaliation prevails in all
        its rigour. If a quarrel takes place, and somebody tears out his own
        eye or kills himself, his adversary must do the same either to
        himself or to one of his relations. The women carry this barbarity
        still further. For a slight affront put on them, a sharp word said to
        them, they will go and smash their head against the door of her who
        offended them, and the latter is obliged immediately to do the same.
        If a woman poisons herself by drinking the juice of a poisonous herb,
        the other woman who drove her to this violent death must poison
        herself likewise; else her house will be burned, her cattle carried
        off, and injuries of all kinds done her until satisfaction is given.
        They extend this cruelty even to their own children. Not long ago, a
        few steps from the church in which I have the honour to write to you,
        two of these barbarians having quarrelled, one of them ran to his
        house, took from it a child of about four years, and crushed its head
        between two stones in the presence of his enemy. The latter, without
        exhibiting any emotion, took his nine-years' old daughter, and,
        plunging a dagger into her breast, said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Your child was only four years old, mine was nine years
        old. Give me a victim to equal her.’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Certainly,’</span> replied the other, and seeing at his
        side his eldest son, who was ready to be married, he stabbed him four
        or five times with his dagger; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class=

        two sons, he killed his wife too, in order to oblige his enemy to
        murder his wife in like manner. Lastly, a little girl and a baby at
        the breast had also their throats cut, so that in a single day seven
        persons were sacrificed to the vengeance of two bloodthirsty men,
        more cruel than the most ferocious brutes. I have actually in my
        church a young man who sought refuge among us, wounded by a
        spear-thrust which his father inflicted on him in order to kill him
        and thus oblige his foe to slay his own son in like manner. The
        barbarian had already stabbed two of his children on other occasions
        for the same purpose. Such atrocious examples will seem to you to
        partake more of fable than of truth; but believe me that far from
        exaggerating, I could produce many others not less
        tragical.”</span><a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href=

        mounted the stone with a scimitar in his hand and thrust his head

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Greek author,
        Euphorion of Chalcis, who lived in the age when the eyes of all the
        world were turned on the great conflict between Rome and Carthage for
        the mastery of the Mediterranean, tells us that at Rome it was
        customary to advertise for men who would consent to be beheaded with
        an axe in consideration of receiving a sum of five <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">minae</span></span>, or about twenty pounds of
        our money, to be paid after their death to their heirs. Apparently
        there was no lack of applicants for this hard-earned bounty; for we
        are informed that several candidates would often compete for the
        privilege, each of them arguing that he had the best right to be
        cudgelled to death.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href=

        were these men invited to be beheaded for twenty pounds a piece? and
        why in response to the invitation did they gratuitously, as it would
        seem, express their readiness to suffer a much more painful death
        than simple decapitation? The reasons are not stated by Euphorion in
        the brief extract quoted from his work by Athenaeus, the Greek writer
        who has also preserved for us the testimony of Posidonius to the
        Gallic recklessness of life. But the connexion in which Athenaeus
        cites both these passages suggests that the intention of the Roman as
        of the Gallic practice was merely to minister to the brutal pleasure
        of the spectators; for he inserts his account of the customs in a
        dissertation on banquets, and he had just before described how hired
        ruffians fought and butchered each other at Roman dinner-parties for
        the amusement of the tipsy guests.<a id="noteref_397" name=

        perhaps the men were wanted to be slaughtered at funerals, for we
        know that at Rome a custom formerly prevailed of sacrificing human
        beings at the tomb: the victims were commonly captives or
        slaves,<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href=

        been obtained by advertisement from among the class of needy freemen.
        Such wretches in bidding against each other may have pleaded as a
        reason for giving them the preference that they really deserved for
        their crimes to die a slow and painful death under the cudgel of the
        executioner. This explanation of the custom, which I owe to my friend
        Mr. W. Wyse, is perhaps the most probable. But it is also possible,
        though the language of Euphorion does not lend itself so well to this
        interpretation, that a cudgelling preceded decapitation as part of
        the bargain. If that was so, it would seem that the men were wanted
        to die as substitutes for condemned criminals; for in old Rome
        capital punishment was regularly inflicted in this fashion, the
        malefactors being tied up to a post and scourged with rods before
        they were beheaded with an axe.<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399"

        is nothing improbable in the view that persons could be hired to
        suffer the extreme penalty of the law instead of the real culprits.
        We shall see that a voluntary substitution of the same sort is
        reported on apparently good authority to be still occasionally
        practised in China. However, it is immaterial to our purpose whether
        these men perished to save others, to adorn a funeral, or merely to
        gratify the Roman lust for blood. The one thing that concerns us is
        that in the great age of Rome there were to be found Romans willing,
        nay, eager to barter their lives for a paltry sum of money of which
        they were not even to have the enjoyment. No wonder that men made of
        that stuff founded a great empire, and spread the terror of the Roman
        arms from the Grampians to the tropics.<a id="noteref_400" name=

        145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        their apathy in this respect is furnished by the readiness with which
        in China a man can be induced to suffer death for a sum of money to
        be paid to his relatives. Thus, for example, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“one of the most wealthy of the aboriginal tribes, called

        a certain day every year to worship. At this annual religious
        festival it is, I believe, customary for the wealthy members of the
        tribe to entertain their poorer brethren at a banquet given in honour
        of one who has agreed, for a sum of money paid to his family, to
        allow himself to be offered as a sacrifice on the altar of the dog
        idol. At the end of the banquet the victim, having drunk wine freely,
        is put to death before the idol. This people believe that, were they
        to neglect this rite, they would be visited with pestilence, famine,
        or the sword.”</span><a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href=

        Further, it is said that in China a man condemned to death can
        procure a substitute, who, for a small sum, will voluntarily consent
        to be executed in his stead. The money goes to the substitute's
        kinsfolk, and since to increase the family prosperity at the expense
        of personal suffering is regarded by the Chinese as an act of the
        highest virtue, there is reported to be, just as there used to be in
        ancient Rome, quite a competition among the candidates for death.
        Such a substitution is even recognised by the Chinese authorities,
        except in the case of certain grave crimes, as for instance
        parricide. The local mandarin is probably not averse to the
        arrangement, for he is said to make a pecuniary profit by the
        transaction, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg

        been further softened down. The king still abdicates annually for a
        short time and his place is filled by a more or less nominal
        sovereign; but at the close of his short reign the latter is no
        longer killed, though sometimes a mock execution still survives as a
        memorial of the time when he was actually put to death. To take
        examples. In the month of Méac (February) the king of Cambodia
        annually abdicated for three days. During this time he performed no
        act of authority, he did not touch the seals, he did not even receive
        the revenues which fell due. In his stead there reigned a temporary
        king called Sdach Méac, that is, King February. The office of
        temporary king was hereditary in a family distantly connected with
        the royal house, the sons succeeding the fathers and the younger
        brothers the elder brothers, just as in the succession to the real
        sovereignty. On a favourable day fixed by the astrologers the
        temporary king was conducted by the mandarins in triumphal
        procession. He rode one of the royal elephants, seated in the royal
        palanquin, and escorted by soldiers who, dressed in appropriate
        costumes, represented the neighbouring peoples of Siam, Annam, Laos,
        and so on. In place of the golden crown he wore a peaked white cap,
        and his regalia, instead of being of gold encrusted with diamonds,
        were of rough wood. After paying homage to the real king, from whom
        he received the sovereignty for three days, together with all
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149"
        id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the revenues accruing during
        that time (though this last custom has been omitted for some time),
        he moved in procession round the palace and through the streets of
        the capital. On the third day, after the usual procession, the
        temporary king gave orders that the elephants should trample under
        foot the <span class="tei tei-q">“mountain of rice,”</span> which was
        a scaffold of bamboo surrounded by sheaves of rice. The people
        gathered up the rice, each man taking home a little with him to
        secure a good harvest. Some of it was also taken to the king, who had
        it cooked and presented to the monks.<a id="noteref_407" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Siam on the
        sixth day of the moon in the sixth month (the end of April) a
        temporary king is appointed, who for three days enjoys the royal
        prerogatives, the real king remaining shut up in his palace. This
        temporary king sends his numerous satellites in all directions to
        seize and confiscate whatever they can find in the bazaar and open
        shops; even the ships and junks which arrive in harbour during the
        three days are forfeited to him and must be redeemed. He goes to a
        field in the middle of the city, whither they bring a gilded plough
        drawn by gaily-decked oxen. After the plough has been anointed and
        the oxen rubbed with incense, the mock king traces nine furrows with
        the plough, followed by aged dames of the palace scattering the first
        seed of the season. As soon as the nine furrows are drawn, the crowd
        of spectators rushes in and scrambles for the seed which has just
        been sown, believing that, mixed with the seed-rice, it will ensure a
        plentiful crop. Then the oxen are unyoked, and rice, maize, sesame,
        sago, bananas, sugar-cane, melons, and so on, are set before them;
        whatever they eat first will, it is thought, be dear in the year
        following, though some people interpret the omen in the opposite
        sense. During this time the temporary king stands leaning against a
        tree with his right foot resting on his left knee. From standing thus
        on one foot he is popularly known as King Hop; but his official title
        is Phaya Phollathep, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the Heavenly
        Hosts.”</span><a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href=
        "#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Agriculture; all disputes about fields, rice, and so forth, are
        referred to him. There is moreover another ceremony in which he
        personates the king. It takes place in the second month (which falls
        in the cold season) and lasts three days. He is conducted in
        procession to an open place opposite the Temple of the Brahmans,
        where there are a number of poles dressed like May-poles, upon which
        the Brahmans swing. All the while that they swing and dance, the Lord
        of the Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one foot upon a seat which is
        made of bricks plastered over, covered with a white cloth, and hung
        with tapestry. He is supported by a wooden frame with a gilt canopy,
        and two Brahmans stand one on each side of him. The dancing Brahmans
        carry buffalo horns with which they draw water from a large copper
        caldron and sprinkle it on the spectators; this is supposed to bring
        good luck, causing the people to dwell in peace and quiet, health and
        prosperity. The time during which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has
        to stand on one foot is about three hours. This is thought
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to prove the dispositions of the Devattas
        and spirits.”</span> If he lets his foot down <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he is liable to forfeit his property and have his family
        enslaved by the king; as it is believed to be a bad omen, portending
        destruction to the state, and instability to the throne. But if he
        stand firm he is believed to have gained a victory over evil spirits,
        and he has moreover the privilege, ostensibly at least, of seizing
        any ship which may enter the harbour during these three days, and
        taking its contents, and also of entering any open shop in the town
        and carrying away what he chooses.”</span><a id="noteref_409" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
        duties and privileges of the Siamese King Hop down to about the
        middle of the nineteenth century or later. Under the reign of the
        late enlightened monarch this quaint personage was to some extent
        both shorn of the glories and relieved of the burden of his office.
        He still watches, as of old, the Brahmans rushing through the air in
        a swing suspended between two tall masts, each some ninety feet high;
        but he is allowed to sit instead of stand, and, although public
        opinion still expects him to keep his right foot on his left knee
        during the whole of the ceremony, he would incur no legal penalty
        were he, to the great chagrin of the people, to put his weary foot to
        the ground. Other signs, too, tell of the invasion of the East by the
        ideas and civilisation of the West. The thoroughfares that lead to
        the scene of the performance are blocked with carriages: lamp-posts
        and telegraph posts, to which eager spectators cling like monkeys,
        rise above the dense crowd; and, while a tatterdemalion band of the
        old style, in gaudy garb of vermilion and yellow, bangs and tootles
        away on drums and trumpets of an antique pattern, the procession of
        barefooted soldiers in brilliant uniforms steps briskly along to the

        their hair and beards. Then they repaired to a forest near the

        fool's cap and a long flaxen beard, and is enveloped in a strange
        mantle. With a wand of office in his hand and attended by men
        disguised as scribes, executioners, and so forth, he proceeds to the
        Governor's house. The latter allows himself to be deposed; and the
        mock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to the decisions of
        which even the governor and his officials must bow. After three days
        the mock king is condemned to death; the envelope or shell in which
        he was encased is committed to the flames, and from its ashes the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mohammedan
        students of Fez, in Morocco, are allowed to appoint a sultan of their
        own, who reigns for a few weeks, and is known as <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Sultan
        t-tulba</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sultan of the
        Scribes.”</span> This brief authority is put up for auction and
        knocked down to the highest bidder. It brings some substantial
        privileges with it, for the holder is freed from taxes thenceforward,
        and he has the right of asking a favour from the real sultan. That
        favour is seldom refused; it usually consists in the release of a
        prisoner. Moreover, the agents of the student-sultan levy fines on
        the shopkeepers and householders, against whom they trump up various
        humorous charges. The temporary sultan is surrounded with the pomp of
        a real court, and parades the streets in state with music and
        shouting, while a royal umbrella is held over his head. With the
        so-called fines and free-will offerings, to which the real sultan
        adds a liberal supply of provisions, the students have enough to
        furnish forth a magnificent banquet; and altogether they enjoy
        themselves thoroughly, indulging in all kinds of games and
        amusements. For the first seven days the mock sultan remains in the
        college; then he goes about a mile out of the town and encamps on the
        bank of the river, attended by the students and not a few of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153"
        id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> citizens. On the seventh day
        of his stay outside the town he is visited by the real sultan, who
        grants him his request and gives him seven more days to reign, so
        that the reign of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sultan of the
        Scribes”</span> nominally lasts three weeks. But when six days of the
        last week have passed the mock sultan runs back to the town by night.
        This temporary sultanship always falls in spring, about the beginning
        of April. Its origin is said to have been as follows. When Mulai
        Rasheed II. was fighting for the throne in 1664 or 1665, a certain
        Jew usurped the royal authority at Taza. But the rebellion was soon
        suppressed through the loyalty and devotion of the students. To
        effect their purpose they resorted to an ingenious stratagem. Forty
        of them caused themselves to be packed in chests which were sent as a
        present to the usurper. In the dead of night, while the unsuspecting
        Jew was slumbering peacefully among the packing-cases, the lids were
        stealthily raised, the brave forty crept forth, slew the usurper, and
        took possession of the city in the name of the real sultan, who, to
        mark his gratitude for the help thus rendered him in time of need,
        conferred on the students the right of annually appointing a sultan
        of their own.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href=

        Lostwithiel in Cornwall down to the sixteenth century. On
        <span class="tei tei-q">“little Easter Sunday”</span> the freeholders
        of the town and manor assembled together, either in person or by
        their deputies, and one among them, as it fell to his lot by turn,
        gaily attired and gallantly mounted, with a crown on his head, a
        sceptre in his hand, and a sword borne before him, rode through the
        principal street to the church, dutifully attended by all the rest on
        horseback. The clergyman in his best robes received him at the
        churchyard stile and conducted him to hear divine service. On leaving
        the church he repaired, with the same pomp, to a <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> house provided for his reception. Here a
        feast awaited him and his suite, and being set at the head of the
        table he was served on bended knees, with all the rites due to the
        estate of a prince. The ceremony ended with the dinner, and every man

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
        temporary king occupies the throne, not annually, but once for all at
        the beginning of each reign. Thus in the kingdom of Jambi, in
        Sumatra, it is the custom that at the beginning of a new reign a man
        of the people should occupy the throne and exercise the royal
        prerogatives for a single day. The origin of the custom is explained
        by a tradition that there were once five royal brothers, the four
        elder of whom all declined the throne on the ground of various bodily
        defects, leaving it to their youngest brother. But the eldest
        occupied the throne for one day, and reserved for his descendants a
        similar privilege at the beginning of every reign. Thus the office of
        temporary king is hereditary in a family akin to the royal
        house.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=
        "#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> In
        Bilaspur it seems to be the custom, after the death of a Rajah, for a
        Brahman to eat rice out of the dead Rajah's hand, and then to occupy
        the throne for a year. At the end of the year the Brahman receives
        presents and is dismissed from the territory, being forbidden
        apparently to return. <span class="tei tei-q">“The idea seems to be
        that the spirit of the Rájá enters into the Bráhman who eats the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">khír</span></span> (rice and milk) out of his
        hand when he is dead, as the Brahman is apparently carefully watched
        during the whole year, and not allowed to go away.”</span> The same
        or a similar custom is believed to obtain among the hill states about
        Kangra.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href=

        custom of banishing the Brahman who represents the king may be a
        substitute for putting him to death. At the installation of a prince
        of Carinthia a peasant, in whose family the office <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was hereditary, ascended a marble stone
        which stood surrounded by meadows in a spacious valley; on his right
        stood a black mother-cow, on his left a lean ugly mare. A rustic
        crowd gathered about him. Then the future prince, dressed as a
        peasant and carrying a shepherd's staff, drew near, attended by
        courtiers and magistrates. On perceiving him the peasant called out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is this whom I see coming so proudly
        along?”</span> The people answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“The

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some points about
        these temporary kings deserve to be specially noticed before we pass
        to the next branch of the evidence. In the first place, the Cambodian
        and Siamese examples shew clearly that it is especially the divine or
        magical functions of the king which are transferred to his temporary
        substitute. This appears from the belief that by keeping up his foot
        the temporary king of Siam gained a victory over the evil spirits,
        whereas by letting it down he imperilled the existence of the state.
        Again, the Cambodian ceremony of trampling down the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“mountain of rice,”</span> and the Siamese ceremony of
        opening the ploughing and sowing, are charms to produce a plentiful
        harvest, as appears from the belief that those who carry home some of
        the trampled rice, or of the seed sown, will thereby secure a good
        crop. Moreover, when the Siamese representative of the king is
        guiding the plough, the people watch him anxiously, not to see
        whether he drives a straight furrow, but to mark the exact point on
        his leg to which the skirt of his silken robe reaches; for on that is
        supposed to hang the state of the weather and the crops during the
        ensuing season. If the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts hitches
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156"
        id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> up his garment above his knee,
        the weather will be wet and heavy rains will spoil the harvest. If he
        lets it trail to his ankle, a drought will be the consequence. But
        fine weather and heavy crops will follow if the hem of his robe hangs
        exactly half-way down the calf of his leg.<a id="noteref_419" name=
        "noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> So
        closely is the course of nature, and with it the weal or woe of the
        people, dependent on the minutest act or gesture of the king's
        representative. But the task of making the crops grow, thus deputed
        to the temporary kings, is one of the magical functions regularly
        supposed to be discharged by kings in primitive society. The rule
        that the mock king must stand on one foot upon a raised seat in the
        rice-field was perhaps originally meant as a charm to make the crop
        grow high; at least this was the object of a similar ceremony
        observed by the old Prussians. The tallest girl, standing on one foot
        upon a seat, with her lap full of cakes, a cup of brandy in her right
        hand and a piece of elm-bark or linden-bark in her left, prayed to
        the god Waizganthos that the flax might grow as high as she was
        standing. Then, after draining the cup, she had it refilled, and
        poured the brandy on the ground as an offering to Waizganthos, and
        threw down the cakes for his attendant sprites. If she remained
        steady on one foot throughout the ceremony, it was an omen that the
        flax crop would be good; but if she let her foot down, it was feared
        that the crop might fail.<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href=
        "#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> The
        same significance perhaps attaches to the swinging of the Brahmans,
        which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts had formerly to witness standing
        on one foot. On the principles of homoeopathic or imitative magic it
        might <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name=
        "Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be thought that the
        higher the priests swing the higher will grow the rice. For the
        ceremony is described as a harvest festival,<a id="noteref_421" name=
        "noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> and
        swinging is practised by the Letts of Russia with the avowed
        intention of influencing the growth of the crops. In the spring and
        early summer, between Easter and St. John's Day (the summer
        solstice), every Lettish peasant is said to devote his leisure hours
        to swinging diligently; for the higher he rises in the air the higher
        will his flax grow that season.<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the foregoing
        cases the temporary king is appointed annually in accordance with a
        regular custom. But in other cases the appointment is made only to
        meet a special emergency, such as to relieve the real king from some
        actual or threatened evil by diverting it to a substitute, who takes
        his place on the throne for a short time. The history of Persia
        furnishes instances of such occasional substitutes for the Shah. Thus
        Shah Abbas the Great, the most eminent of all the kings of Persia,
        who reigned from 1586 to 1628 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, being warned by his
        astrologers in the year 1591 that a serious danger impended over him,
        attempted to avert the omen by abdicating the throne and appointing a
        certain unbeliever named Yusoofee, probably a Christian, to reign in
        his stead. The substitute was accordingly crowned, and for three
        days, if we may trust the Persian historians, he enjoyed not only the
        name and the state but the power of the king. At the end of his brief
        reign he was put to death: the decree of the stars was fulfilled by
        this sacrifice; and Abbas, who reascended his throne in a most
        propitious hour, was promised by his astrologers a long and glorious
        reign.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href=

        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, was crowned a second
        time and changed his name to Sulaiman or Soliman under the following
        circumstances: <span class="tei tei-q">“The King, a few days after,
        was out of danger, but the matter was to restore him to perfect
        health. Having been always in a languishing condition, and his
        physicians never able to discover the cause of his distemper, he
        suspected that their ignorance retarded his recovery, and two or
        three of them were therefore ill treated. At length the other
        physicians, fearing it might be their own turn next, bethought
        themselves, that Persia being at the same time afflicted with a
        scarcity of provisions and the King's sickness, the fault must be in
        the astrologers, who had not chosen a favourable hour when the King
        was set upon the throne, and therefore persuaded him that the
        ceremony must be perform'd again, and he change his name in a more
        lucky minute. The King and his council approving of their notion, the
        physicians and astrologers together expected the first unfortunate
        day, which, according to their superstition, was to be followed in
        the evening by a propitious hour. Among the Gavres, or original
        Persians, Worshippers of Fire, there are some who boast their descent
        from the Rustans, who formerly reigned over Persia and Parthia. On
        the morning of the aforesaid unlucky day, they took one of these
        Gavres of that Blood-royal, and having plac'd him on the throne, with
        his back against a figure that represented him to the life, all the
        great men of the court came to attend him, as if he had been their
        king, performing all that he commanded. This scene lasted till the
        favourable hour, which was a little before sun-setting, and then an
        officer of the court came behind and cut off the head of the wooden
        statue with his cymiter, the Gaure then starting up and running away.
        That very moment the King came into the hall, and the Sofy's cap
        being set on his head, and his sword girt to his side, he sat down on
        the throne, changing his name for that of Soliman, which was
        perform'd with the usual ceremonies, the drums beating and trumpets
        sounding as before. It was requisite to act this farce, in order to
        satisfy the law, which requires that in order to change his name and
        take possession of the throne again he must expel a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> prince that had usurped it upon some
        pretensions; and therefore they made choice of a Gaure, who pretended
        to be descended from the ancient kings of Persia, and was besides of
        a different religion from that of the government.”</span><a id=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A point to notice
        about the temporary kings described in the foregoing chapter is that
        in two places (Cambodia and Jambi) they come of a stock which is
        believed to be akin to the royal family. If the view here taken of
        the origin of these temporary kingships is correct, we can easily
        understand why the king's substitute should sometimes be of the same
        race as the king. When the king first succeeded in getting the life
        of another accepted as a sacrifice instead of his own, he would have
        to shew that the death of that other would serve the purpose quite as
        well as his own would have done. Now it was as a god or demigod that
        the king had to die; therefore the substitute who died for him had to
        be invested, at least for the occasion, with the divine attributes of
        the king. This, as we have just seen, was certainly the case with the
        temporary kings of Siam and Cambodia; they were invested with the
        supernatural functions, which in an earlier stage of society were the
        special attributes of the king. But no one could so well represent
        the king in his divine character as his son, who might be supposed to
        share the divine afflatus of his father. No one, therefore, could so
        appropriately die for the king and, through him, for the whole
        people, as the king's son.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
        tradition, Aun or On, King of Sweden, sacrificed nine of his sons to
        Odin at Upsala in order that his own life might be spared. After he
        had sacrificed his second son he received from the god an answer that
        he should live so long as he gave him one of his sons every ninth
        year. When he had sacrificed his seventh son, he still <span class=

        not walk but had to be carried in a chair. Then he offered up his
        eighth son, and lived nine years more, lying in his bed. After that
        he sacrificed his ninth son, and lived another nine years, but so
        that he drank out of a horn like a weaned child. He now wished to
        sacrifice his only remaining son to Odin, but the Swedes would not
        allow him. So he died and was buried in a mound at Upsala. The poet
        Thiodolf told the king's history in verse:—</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In ancient Greece
        there seems to have been at least one kingly house of great antiquity
        of which the eldest sons were always liable to be sacrificed in room
        of their royal sires. When Xerxes was marching through Thessaly at
        the head of his mighty host to attack the Spartans at Thermopylae, he
        came to the town of Alus. Here he was shewn the sanctuary of
        Laphystian Zeus, about which his guides told him a strange tale. It
        ran somewhat as follows. Once upon a time the king of the country, by
        name Athamas, married a wife Nephele, and had by her a son called
        Phrixus and a daughter named Helle. Afterwards he took to himself a
        second wife called Ino, by whom he had two sons, Learchus and
        Melicertes. But his second wife was jealous of her step-children,
        Phrixus and Helle, and plotted their death. She went about very
        cunningly to compass her bad end. First of all she persuaded the
        women of the country to roast the seed corn secretly before it was
        committed to the ground. So next year no crops came <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> up and the people died of famine. Then
        the king sent messengers to the oracle at Delphi to enquire the cause
        of the dearth. But the wicked step-mother bribed the messenger to
        give out as the answer of the god that the dearth would never cease
        till the children of Athamas by his first wife had been sacrificed to
        Zeus. When Athamas heard that, he sent for the children, who were
        with the sheep. But a ram with a fleece of gold opened his lips, and
        speaking with the voice of a man warned the children of their danger.
        So they mounted the ram and fled with him over land and sea. As they
        flew over the sea, the girl slipped from the animal's back, and
        falling into water was drowned. But her brother Phrixus was brought
        safe to the land of Colchis, where reigned a child of the Sun.
        Phrixus married the king's daughter, and she bore him a son
        Cytisorus. And there he sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to
        Zeus the God of Flight; but some will have it that he sacrificed the
        animal to Laphystian Zeus. The golden fleece itself he gave to his
        wife's father, who nailed it to an oak tree, guarded by a sleepless
        dragon in a sacred grove of Ares. Meanwhile at home an oracle had
        commanded that King Athamas himself should be sacrificed as an
        expiatory offering for the whole country. So the people decked him
        with garlands like a victim and led him to the altar, where they were
        just about to sacrifice him when he was rescued either by his
        grandson Cytisorus, who arrived in the nick of time from Colchis, or
        by Hercules, who brought tidings that the king's son Phrixus was yet
        alive. Thus Athamas was saved, but afterwards he went mad, and
        mistaking his son Learchus for a wild beast shot him dead. Next he
        attempted the life of his remaining son Melicertes, but the child was
        rescued by his mother Ino, who ran and threw herself and him from a
        high rock into the sea. Mother and son were changed into marine
        divinities, and the son received special homage in the isle of
        Tenedos, where babes were sacrificed to him. Thus bereft of wife and
        children the unhappy Athamas quitted his country, and on enquiring of
        the oracle where he should dwell was told to take up his abode
        wherever he should be entertained by wild beasts. He fell in with a
        pack of wolves devouring sheep, and when they saw him they
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163"
        id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fled and left him the bleeding
        remnants of their prey. In this way the oracle was fulfilled. But
        because King Athamas had not been sacrificed as a sin-offering for
        the whole country, it was divinely decreed that the eldest male scion
        of his family in each generation should be sacrificed without fail,
        if ever he set foot in the town-hall, where the offerings were made
        to Laphystian Zeus by one of the house of Athamas. Many of the
        family, Xerxes was informed, had fled to foreign lands to escape this
        doom; but some of them had returned long afterwards, and being caught
        by the sentinels in the act of entering the town-hall were wreathed
        as victims, led forth in procession, and sacrificed.<a id=

        instances appear to have been notorious, if not frequent; for the
        writer of a dialogue attributed to Plato, after speaking of the
        immolation of human victims by the Carthaginians, adds that such
        practices were not unknown among the Greeks, and he refers with
        horror to the sacrifices offered on Mount Lycaeus and by the
        descendants of Athamas.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The suspicion that
        this barbarous custom by no means fell into disuse even in later days
        is strengthened by a case of human sacrifice which occurred in
        Plutarch's time at Orchomenus, a very ancient city of Boeotia,
        distant only a few miles across the plain from the historian's
        birthplace. Here dwelt a family of which the men went by the name of
        Psoloeis or <span class="tei tei-q">“Sooty,”</span> and the women by
        the name of Oleae or <span class="tei tei-q">“Destructive.”</span>
        Every year at the festival of the Agrionia the priest of Dionysus
        pursued these women with a drawn sword, and if he overtook one of
        them he had the right to slay her. In Plutarch's lifetime the right
        was actually exercised by a priest Zoilus. Now the family thus liable
        to furnish at least one human victim every year was of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> royal descent, for they traced their
        lineage to Minyas, the famous old king of Orchomenus, the monarch of
        fabulous wealth, whose stately treasury, as it is called, still
        stands in ruins at the point where the long rocky hill of Orchomenus
        melts into the vast level expanse of the Copaic plain. Tradition ran
        that the king's three daughters long despised the other women of the
        country for yielding to the Bacchic frenzy, and sat at home in the
        king's house scornfully plying the distaff and the loom, while the
        rest, wreathed with flowers, their dishevelled locks streaming to the
        wind, roamed in ecstasy the barren mountains that rise above
        Orchomenus, making the solitude of the hills to echo to the wild
        music of cymbals and tambourines. But in time the divine fury
        infected even the royal damsels in their quiet chamber; they were
        seized with a fierce longing to partake of human flesh, and cast lots
        among themselves which should give up her child to furnish a cannibal
        feast. The lot fell on Leucippe, and she surrendered her son
        Hippasus, who was torn limb from limb by the three. From these
        misguided women sprang the Oleae and the Psoloeis, of whom the men
        were said to be so called because they wore sad-coloured raiment in
        token of their mourning and grief.<a id="noteref_430" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now this practice
        of taking human victims from a family of royal descent at Orchomenus
        is all the more significant because Athamas himself is said to have
        reigned in the land of Orchomenus even before the time of Minyas, and
        because over against the city there rises Mount Laphystius, on which,
        as at Alus in Thessaly, there was a sanctuary of Laphystian Zeus,
        where, according to tradition, Athamas purposed to sacrifice his two
        children Phrixus and Helle.<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431"

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> On the
        whole, comparing the traditions about Athamas with the custom that
        obtained with regard to his descendants in historical times, we may
        fairly infer that in Thessaly and probably in Boeotia there reigned
        of old a dynasty of which the kings were liable <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to be sacrificed for the good of the
        country to the god called Laphystian Zeus, but that they contrived to
        shift the fatal responsibility to their offspring, of whom the eldest
        son was regularly destined to the altar. As time went on, the cruel
        custom was so far mitigated that a ram was accepted as a vicarious
        sacrifice in room of the royal victim, provided always that the
        prince abstained from setting foot in the town-hall where the
        sacrifices were offered to Laphystian Zeus by one of his
        kinsmen.<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href=
        "#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> But if
        he were rash enough to enter the place of doom, to thrust himself
        wilfully, as it were, on the notice of the god who had good-naturedly
        winked at the substitution of a ram, the ancient obligation which had
        been suffered to lie in abeyance recovered all its force, and there
        was no help for it but he must die. The tradition which associated
        the sacrifice of the king or his children with a great dearth points
        clearly to the belief, so common among primitive folk, that the king
        is responsible for the weather and the crops, and that he may justly
        pay with his life for the inclemency of the one or the failure of the
        other. Athamas and his line, in short, appear to have united divine
        or magical with royal functions; and this view is strongly supported
        by the claims to divinity which Salmoneus, the brother of Athamas, is
        said to have set up. We have seen that this presumptuous mortal
        professed to be no other than Zeus himself, and to wield the thunder
        and lightning, of which he made a trumpery imitation by the help of
        tinkling kettles and blazing torches.<a id="noteref_433" name=

        all events the history of this remarkable people, who combined in so
        high a degree the spirit of commercial enterprise with a blind
        attachment to a stern and gloomy religion, is stained in later times
        with instances of the same cruel superstition. When the Carthaginians
        were defeated and besieged by Agathocles, they ascribed their
        disasters to the wrath of Baal; for whereas in former times they had
        been wont to sacrifice to him their own offspring, they had latterly
        fallen into the habit of buying children and rearing them to be
        victims. So, to appease the angry god, two hundred children of the
        noblest families were picked out for sacrifice, and the tale of
        victims was swelled by not less than three hundred more who
        volunteered to die for the fatherland. They were sacrificed by being
        placed, one by one, on the sloping hands of the brazen image, from
        which they rolled into a pit of fire.<a id="noteref_441" name=

        Childless people among the Carthaginians bought children from poor
        parents and slaughtered them, says Plutarch, as if they were lambs or
        chickens; and the mother had to stand by and see it done without a
        tear or a groan, for if she wept or moaned she lost all the credit
        and the child was sacrificed none the less. But all the place in
        front of the image was filled with a tumultuous music of fifes and
        drums to drown the shrieks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg

        the Hebrews lapsed, or rather perhaps relapsed, into that congenial
        mire of superstition from which the higher spirits of the nation
        struggled—too often in vain—to rescue them. The Psalmist laments that

        at Jerusalem, we are told that <span class="tei tei-q">“he burnt
        incense in the valley of Hinnom, and burnt his children <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the fire.”</span><a id="noteref_450"
        name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a> Again,
        King Manasseh, whose long reign covered fifty-five years,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“made his children to pass through the fire
        in the valley of Hinnom.”</span><a id="noteref_451" name=
        "noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a>
        Afterwards in the reign of the good king Josiah the idolatrous
        excesses of the people were repressed, at least for a time, and among
        other measures of reform Tophet was defiled by the King's orders,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that no man might make his son or his
        daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.”</span><a id=

        the place was ever used again for the same dark purpose as before
        does not appear. Long afterwards, under the sway of a milder faith,
        there was little in the valley to recall the tragic scenes which it
        had so often witnessed. Jerome describes it as a pleasant and shady
        spot, watered by the rills of Siloam and laid out in delightful
        gardens.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href=

        contact with the old inhabitants of the land, that the primitive
        purity of faith and morals which they brought with them from the free

        corruption of the heathen in the fat land of Canaan. When we
        remember, however, that the Israelites were of the same Semitic stock
        as the population they conquered and professed to despise,<a id=

        that the practice of human sacrifice is attested for many branches of
        the Semitic race, we shall, perhaps, incline to surmise that the
        chosen people may have brought with them into Palestine the seeds
        which afterwards sprang up and bore such ghastly fruit in the valley
        of Hinnom. It is at least significant of the prevalence of such
        customs among the Semites that no sooner were the native
        child-burning Israelites carried off by King Shalmaneser to Assyria
        than their place was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg

        pious Jewish historian, who saw in Israel's exile God's punishment

        the very same abominations for which the erring Hebrews had just been
        so signally chastised.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have still to
        ask which of their children the Semites picked out for sacrifice; for
        that a choice was made and some principle of selection followed, may
        be taken for granted. A people who burned all their children
        indiscriminately would soon extinguish themselves, and such an excess
        of piety is probably rare, if not unknown. In point of fact it seems,
        at least among the Hebrews, to have been only the firstborn child
        that was doomed to the flames. The prophet Micah asks, in a familiar
        passage, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherewith shall I come before the
        Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him
        with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be
        pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of
        oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my
        body for the sin of my soul?”</span> These were the questions which
        pious and doubting hearts were putting to themselves in the days of
        the prophet. The prophet's own answer is not doubtful. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
        the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy, and to
        walk humbly with thy God?”</span><a id="noteref_456" name=
        "noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> It is a
        noble answer and one which only elect spirits in that or, perhaps, in
        any age have given. In Israel the vulgar answer was given on bloody
        altars and in the smoke and flames of Tophet, and the form in which
        the prophet's question is cast—<span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I give
        my firstborn for my transgression?”</span>—shews plainly on which of
        the children the duty of atoning for the sins of their father was
        supposed to fall. A passage in Ezekiel points <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no less clearly to the same conclusion.
        The prophet represents God as saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I gave
        them statutes that were not good, and judgments wherein they should
        not live; and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused
        to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make
        them desolate.”</span> That the writer was here thinking specially of
        the sacrifice of children is proved by his own words a little later
        on. <span class="tei tei-q">“When ye offer your gifts, when ye make
        your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all
        your idols, unto this day?”</span><a id="noteref_457" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a>
        Further, that by the words <span class="tei tei-q">“to pass through
        the fire all that openeth the womb”</span> he referred only to the
        firstborn can easily be shewn by the language of Scripture in
        reference to that law of the consecration of firstlings which Ezekiel
        undoubtedly had in his mind when he wrote this passage. Thus we find
        that law enunciated in the following terms: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto me
        all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of
        Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.”</span><a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> Again,
        it is written: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt set apart unto the
        Lord all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast
        that cometh of a beast; the males shall be the Lord's.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> Once
        more: <span class="tei tei-q">“All that openeth the womb is mine; and
        all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of ox and
        sheep.”</span><a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href=
        "#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a> This
        ancient Hebrew custom of the consecration to God of all male
        firstlings, whether of man or beast, was merely the application to
        the animal kingdom of the law that all first fruits whatsoever belong
        to the deity and must be made over to him or his representatives.
        That general law is thus stated by the Hebrew legislator:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not delay to offer of the
        abundance of thy fruits, and of thy liquors. The firstborn of thy
        sons shalt thou give unto me. Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen,
        and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; and on the
        eighth day thou shalt give it me.”</span><a id="noteref_461" name=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the god of

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of men and the firstlings of animals as his
        own, and required that they should be made over to him. But how? Here
        a distinction was drawn between sheep, oxen, and goats on the one
        hand and men and asses on the other; the firstlings of the former
        were always sacrificed, the firstlings of the latter were generally
        redeemed. <span class="tei tei-q">“The firstling of an ox, or the
        firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not
        redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the
        altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a
        sweet savour unto the Lord.”</span> The flesh went to the
        Levites,<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href=
        "#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        consumed it, no doubt, instead of the deity whom they represented. On
        the other hand, the ass was not sacrificed by the Israelites,
        probably because they did not eat the animal themselves, and hence
        concluded that God did not do so either. In the matter of diet the
        taste of gods generally presents a striking resemblance to that of
        their worshippers. Still the firstling ass, like all other
        firstlings, was sacred to the deity, and since it was not sacrificed
        to him, he had to receive an equivalent for it. In other words, the
        ass had to be redeemed, and the price of the redemption was a lamb
        which was burnt as a vicarious sacrifice instead of the ass, on the
        hypothesis, apparently, that roast lamb is likely to be more
        palatable to the Supreme Being than roast donkey. If the ass was not
        redeemed, it had to be killed by having its neck broken.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can now readily
        understand why so many of the Hebrews, at least in the later days of
        their history, sacrificed their firstborn children, and why
        tender-hearted parents, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg
        174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        whose affection for their offspring exceeded their devotion to the
        deity, may often have been visited with compunction, and even
        tormented with feelings of bitter self-reproach and shame at their
        carnal weakness in suffering the beloved son to live, when they saw
        others, with an heroic piety which they could not emulate, calmly
        resigning their dear ones to the fire, through which, as they firmly
        believed, they passed to God, to reap, perhaps, in endless bliss in
        heaven the reward of their sharp but transient sufferings on earth.
        From infancy they had been bred up in the belief that the firstborn
        was sacred to God, and though they knew that he had waived his right
        to them in consideration of the receipt of five shekels a head, they
        could, hardly view this as anything but an act of gracious
        condescension, of generous liberality on the part of the divinity who
        had stooped to accept so trifling a sum instead of the life which
        really belonged to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely,”</span> they
        might argue, <span class="tei tei-q">“God would be better pleased if
        we were to give him not the money but the life, not the poor paltry
        shekels, but what we value most, our first and best-loved child. If
        we hold that life so dear, will not he also? It is his. Why should we
        not give him his own?”</span> It was in answer to anxious questions
        such as these, and to quite truly conscientious scruples of this sort
        that the prophet Micah declared that what God required of his true
        worshippers was not sacrifice but justice and mercy and humility. It
        is the answer of morality to religion—of the growing consciousness
        that man's duty is not to propitiate with vain oblations those
        mysterious powers of the universe of which he can know little or
        nothing, but to be just and merciful in his dealings with his fellows
        and to humbly trust, though he cannot know, that by acting thus he
        will best please the higher powers, whatever they may be.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while morality
        ranges itself on the side of the prophet, it may be questioned
        whether history and precedent were not on the side of his
        adversaries. If the firstborn of men and cattle were alike sacred to
        God, and the firstborn of cattle were regularly sacrificed, while the
        firstborn of men were ransomed by a money payment, has not this last
        provision the appearance of being a later mitigation of an older and
        harsher custom which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
        175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        doomed firstborn children, like firstling lambs and calves and goats,
        to the altar or the fire? The suspicion is greatly strengthened by
        the remarkable tradition told to account for the sanctity of the
        firstborn. When Israel was in bondage in Egypt, so runs the
        tradition, God resolved to deliver them from captivity, and to lead
        them to the Promised Land. But the Egyptians were loth to part with
        their bondmen and thwarted the divine purpose by refusing to let the
        Israelites go. Accordingly God afflicted these cruel taskmasters with
        one plague after another, but all in vain, until at last he made up
        his mind to resort to a strong measure, which would surely have the
        desired effect. At dead of night he would pass through the land
        killing all the firstborn of the Egyptians, both man and beast; not
        one of them would be left alive in the morning. But the Israelites
        were warned of what was about to happen and told to keep indoors that
        night, and to put a mark on their houses, so that when he passed down
        the street on his errand of slaughter, God might know them at sight
        from the houses of the Egyptians and not turn in and massacre the
        wrong children and animals. The mark was to be the blood of a lamb
        smeared on the lintel and side posts of the door. In every house the
        lamb, whose red blood was to be the badge of Israel that night, as
        the white scarves were the badge of the Catholics on the night of St.
        Bartholomew, was to be killed at evening and eaten by the household,
        with very peculiar rites, during the hours of darkness while the
        butchery was proceeding: none of the flesh was to see the morning
        light: whatever the family could not eat was to be burned with fire.
        All this was done. The massacre of Egyptian children and animals was
        successfully perpetrated and had the desired effect; and to
        commemorate this great triumph God ordained that all the firstborn of
        man and beast among the Israelites should be sacred to him ever
        afterwards in the manner already described, the edible animals to be
        sacrificed, and the uneatable, especially men and asses, to be
        ransomed by a substitute or by a pecuniary payment of so much a head.
        And a festival was to be celebrated every spring with rites exactly
        like those which were observed on the night of the great slaughter.
        The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The one thing that
        looms clear through the haze of this weird tradition is the memory of
        a great massacre of firstborn. This was the origin, we are told, both
        of the sanctity of the firstborn and of the feast of the Passover.
        But when we are further told that the people whose firstborn were
        slaughtered on that occasion were not the Hebrews but their enemies,
        we are at once met by serious difficulties. Why, we may ask, should
        the Israelites kill the firstlings of their cattle for ever because
        God once killed those of the Egyptians? and why should every Hebrew
        father have to pay God a ransom for his firstborn child because God
        once slew all the firstborn children of the Egyptians? In this form
        the tradition offers no intelligible explanation of the custom. But
        it at once becomes clear and intelligible when we assume that in the
        original version of the story it was the Hebrew firstborn that were
        slain; that in fact the slaughter of the firstborn children was
        formerly, what the slaughter of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the firstborn cattle always continued to be,
        not an isolated butchery but a regular custom, which with the growth
        of more humane sentiments was afterwards softened into the vicarious
        sacrifice of a lamb and the payment of a ransom for each child. Here
        the reader may be reminded of another Hebrew tradition in which the
        sacrifice of the firstborn child is indicated still more clearly.
        Abraham, we are informed, was commanded by God to offer up his
        firstborn son Isaac as a burnt sacrifice, and was on the point of
        obeying the divine command, when God, content with this proof of his
        faith and obedience, substituted for the human victim a ram, which
        Abraham accordingly sacrificed instead of his son.<a id="noteref_466"
        name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a> Putting
        the two traditions together and observing how exactly they dovetail
        into each other and into the later Hebrew practice of actually
        sacrificing the firstborn children by fire to Baal or Moloch, we can
        hardly resist the conclusion that, before the practice of redeeming
        them was introduced, the Hebrews, like the other branches of the
        Semitic race, regularly sacrificed their firstborn children by the
        fire or the knife. The Passover, if this view is right, was the
        occasion when the awful sacrifice was offered; and the tradition of
        its origin has preserved in its main outlines a vivid memory of the
        horrors of these fearful nights. They must have been like the nights
        called Evil on the west coast of Africa, when the people kept
        indoors, because the executioners were going about the streets and
        the heads of the human victims were falling in the king's
        palace.<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href=
        "#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a> But
        seen in the lurid light of superstition or of legend they were no
        common mortals, no vulgar executioners, who did the dreadful work at
        the first Passover. The Angel of Death was abroad that night; into
        every house he entered, and a sound of lamentation followed him as he
        came forth with his dripping sword. The blood that bespattered the
        lintel and door-posts would at first be the blood of the firstborn
        child of the house; and when the blood of a lamb was afterwards
        substituted, we may suppose that it was intended not so much to
        appease as to cheat the ghastly visitant. Seeing the red drops in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178"
        id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the doorway he would say to
        himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is the blood of their child. I
        need not turn in there. I have many yet to slay before the morning
        breaks grey in the east.”</span> And he would pass on in haste. And
        the trembling parents, as they clasped their little one to their
        breast, might fancy that they heard his footfalls growing fainter and
        fainter down the street. In plain words, we may surmise that the
        slaughter was originally done by masked men, like the Mumbo Jumbos
        and similar figures of west Africa, who went from house to house and
        were believed by the uninitiated to be the deity or his divine
        messengers come in person to carry off the victims. When the leaders
        had decided to allow the sacrifice of animals instead of children,
        they would give the people a hint that if they only killed a lamb and
        smeared its blood on the door-posts, the bloodthirsty but
        near-sighted deity would never know the difference.</p>

        birds which fly in flocks by night uttering a loud and peculiar note

        that the Hebrew custom of redeeming the firstborn is a modification

        the converging lines of evidence which point to this conclusion seem
        too numerous and too distinct to be thus lightly brushed aside. And
        the argument from improbability can easily be rebutted by pointing to
        other peoples who are known to have practised or to be still
        practising a custom of the same sort. In some tribes of New South

        sacrificing their children and cattle to him. Among them when a man
        of any standing marries, he becomes a Raba, as it is called, and for
        a certain period after marriage, probably four to eight years, he
        must leave any children that are born to him to die in the bush. No
        Boran cares to contemplate the fearful calamities with which Wak
        would visit him if he failed to discharge this duty. After he ceases
        to be a Raba, a man is circumcised and becomes a Gudda. The
        sky-spirit has no claim on the children born after their father's
        circumcision, but they are sent away at a very early age to be reared
        by the Wata, a low caste of hunters. They remain with these people
        till they are grown up, and then return to their families.<a id=

        remarkable custom it would appear that the circumcision of the father
        is regarded as an atoning sacrifice which redeems the rest of his
        children from the spirit to whom they would otherwise belong. The
        obscure story told by the Israelites to explain the origin of
        circumcision seems also to suggest that the custom was supposed to
        save the life of the child by giving the deity a substitute for
        it.<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href=

        the Kerre, Banna, and Bashada, three tribes in the valley of the Omo
        River, to the south of Abyssinia, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> are in the habit of strangling their firstborn
        children and throwing the bodies away. The Kerre cast the bodies into
        the river Omo, where they are devoured by crocodiles; the other two
        tribes leave them in the forest to be eaten by the hyaenas. The only
        explanation they give of the custom is that it was decreed by their
        ancestors. Captain C. H. Stigand enquired into the practice very
        carefully and was told that <span class="tei tei-q">“for a certain
        number of years after marriage children would be thrown away, and
        after that they would be kept. The number of the first children who
        were strangled, and the period of years during which this was done,
        appears to be variable, but I could not understand what regulated it.
        There was one point, however, about which they were certain, and that
        was that the first-born of all, rich, poor, high and low, had to be
        strangled and thrown away. The chief of the Kerre said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘If I had a child now, it would have to be thrown
        away,’</span> laughing as if it were a great joke. What amused him
        really was that I should be so interested in their custom.”</span> So
        far as Captain Stigand could ascertain, there is no idea of
        sacrificing the children to the crocodiles by throwing them into the
        river. If a Kerre man has a first child born to him while he is on a
        journey away from the river, he will throw the infant away in the

        once upon a time, when summer and winter were jumbled together in a
        bad season, and the fruits of the earth would not ripen, the
        soothsayers enjoined it. At that time a great pillar of iron is said
        to have stood at the entrance of the capital, which in accordance
        with the advice of the soothsayers was broken down by order of the
        king, whereupon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg

        seasons became regular again. To avert the recurrence of such a
        calamity the wizards commanded the king to pour human blood once a
        year on the base of the broken shaft of the pillar, and also upon the
        throne. Since then certain families have been obliged to deliver up
        their firstborn sons, who were sacrificed at an appointed time.<a id=

        the Indians of north Carolina down to the early part of the
        eighteenth century a remarkable ceremony was performed, which seems
        to be most naturally interpreted as a modification of an older custom
        of putting the king's son to death, perhaps as a substitute for his
        father. It is thus described by a writer of that period: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They have a strange custom or ceremony amongst them, to
        call to mind the persecutions and death of the kings their ancestors
        slain by their enemies at certain seasons, and particularly when the
        savages have been at war with any nation, and return from their
        country without bringing home some prisoners of war, or the heads of
        their enemies. The king causes as a perpetual remembrance of all his
        predecessors to beat and wound the best beloved of all his children
        with the same weapons wherewith they had been kill'd in former times,
        to the end that by renewing the wound, their death should be lamented
        afresh. The king and his nation being assembled on these occasions, a
        feast is prepared, and the Indian who is authorised to wound the
        king's son, runs about the house like a distracted person crying and
        making a most hideous noise all the time with the weapon in his hand,
        wherewith he wounds the king's son; this he performs three several
        times, during which interval he presents the king with victuals or
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cassena</span></span>, and it is very strange to
        see the Indian that is thus struck never offers to stir till he is
        wounded the third time, after <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> which he falls down backwards stretching out
        his arms and legs as if he had been ready to expire; then the rest of
        the king's sons and daughters, together with the mother and vast
        numbers of women and girls, fall at his feet and lament and cry most
        bitterly. During this time the king and his retinue are feasting, yet
        with such profound silence for some hours, that not one word or even
        a whisper is to be heard amongst them. After this manner they
        continue till night, which ends in singing, dancing, and the greatest
        joy imaginable.”</span><a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href=

        the idol to be satisfied with him and not to take away his father's

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the ancient
        Italian peoples, especially of the Sabine stock, it was customary in
        seasons of great peril or public calamity, as when the crops had
        failed or a pestilence was raging, to vow that they would sacrifice
        to the gods every creature, whether man or beast, that should be born
        in the following spring. To the creatures thus devoted to sacrifice
        the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the sacred spring”</span> was
        applied. <span class="tei tei-q">“But since,”</span> says Festus,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it seemed cruel to slay innocent boys and
        girls, they were kept till they had grown up, then veiled and driven
        beyond the boundaries.”</span><a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500"
        href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> Several
        Italian peoples, for example the Piceni, Samnites, and Hirpini,
        traced their origin to a <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred
        spring,”</span> that is, to the consecrated youth who had swarmed off
        from the parent stock in consequence of such a vow.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        the Romans were engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Hannibal
        after their great defeat at the Trasimene Lake, they vowed to offer a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred spring”</span> if victory should
        attend their arms and the commonwealth should retrieve its shattered
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187"
        id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fortunes. But the vow extended
        only to all the offspring of sheep, goats, oxen, and swine that
        should be brought forth on Italian mountains, plains, and meadows the
        following spring.<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href=
        "#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> On a
        later occasion, when the Romans pledged themselves again by a similar
        vow, it was decided that by the <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred
        spring”</span> should be meant all the cattle born between the first
        day of March and the last day of April.<a id="noteref_503" name=
        "noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a>
        Although in later times the Italian peoples appear to have resorted
        to measures of this sort only in special emergencies, there was a
        tradition that in former times the consecration of the firstborn to
        the gods had been an annual custom.<a id="noteref_504" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a>
        Accordingly, it seems not impossible that originally the Italians
        may, like the Hebrews and perhaps the Semites in general, have been
        in the habit of dedicating all the firstborn, whether of man or
        beast, and sacrificing them at a great festival in spring.<a id=
        "noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> The
        custom of the <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred spring”</span> was not
        confined to the Italians, but was practised by many other peoples,
        both Greeks and barbarians, in antiquity.<a id="noteref_506" name=

            <span style="font-size: 80%">Different motives may have led to
            the practice of killing the firstborn. A belief in the rebirth of
            souls may in some cases have operated to produce infanticide,
            especially of the firstborn. The Hindoos believe that a man is
            reborn in his son, while at the same time he dies in his own
            person.</span>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it would seem
        that a custom of putting to death all firstborn children has
        prevailed in many parts of the world. What was the motive which led
        people to practise a custom which to us seems at once so cruel and so
        foolish? It cannot have been the purely prudential consideration of
        adjusting the numbers of the tribe to the amount of the food-supply;
        for, in the first place, savages do not take such thought for the
        morrow,<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href=
        "#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> and, in
        the second place, if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
        188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        they did, they would be likely to kill the later born children rather
        than the firstborn. The foregoing evidence suggests that the custom
        may have been practised by different peoples from different motives.
        With the Semites, the Italians, and their near kinsmen the Irish the
        sacrifice or at least the consecration of the firstborn seems to have
        been viewed as a tribute paid to the gods, who were thus content to
        receive a part though they might justly have claimed the whole. In
        some cases the death of the child appears to be definitely regarded
        as a substitute for the death of the father, who obtains a new lease
        of life by the sacrifice of his offspring. This comes out clearly in
        the tradition of Aun, King of Sweden, who sacrificed one of his sons
        every nine years to Odin in order to prolong his own life.<a id=
        "noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> And in
        Peru also the son died that the father might live.<a id="noteref_509"
        name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a> But in
        some cases it would seem that the child has been killed, not so much
        as a substitute for the father, as because it is supposed to endanger
        his life by absorbing his spiritual essence or vital energy. In fact,
        a belief in the transmigration or rebirth of souls has operated to
        produce a regular custom of infanticide, especially infanticide of
        the firstborn. At Whydah, on the Slave coast of West Africa, where
        the doctrine of reincarnation is firmly held, it has happened that a
        child has been put to death because the fetish doctors declared it to
        be the king's father come to life again. The king naturally could not
        submit to be pushed from the throne by his predecessor in this
        fashion; so he compelled his supposed parent to return to the world
        of the dead from which he had very inopportunely effected his
        escape.<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=
        "#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a> The
        Hindoos are of opinion that a man is literally reborn in the person
        of his son. Thus in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Laws of Manu</span></span> we read that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the husband, after conception by his wife,
        becomes an embryo and is born again of her; for that is the wifehood
        of a wife, that he is born again by her.”</span><a id="noteref_511"

        after the birth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
        189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        a son the father is clearly in a very delicate position. Since he is
        his own son, can he himself, apart from his son, be said to exist?
        Does he not rather die in his own person as soon as he comes to life
        in the person of his son? This appears to be the opinion of the
        subtle Hindoo, for in some sections of the Khatris, a mercantile
        caste of the Punjaub, funeral rites are actually performed for the
        father in the fifth month of his wife's pregnancy. But apparently he
        is allowed, by a sort of legal fiction, to come to life again in his
        own person; for after the birth of his first son he is formally
        remarried to his wife, which may be regarded as a tacit admission
        that in the eye of the law at least he is alive.<a id="noteref_512"

        thus conceive the relation of father and son it is plain that
        fatherhood must appear a very dubious privilege; for if you die in
        begetting a son, can you be quite sure of coming to life again? His
        existence is at the best a menace to yours, and at the worst it may
        involve your extinction. The danger seems to lie especially in the
        birth of your first son; if only you can tide that over, you are,
        humanly speaking, safe. In fact, it comes to this, Are you to live?
        or is he? It is a painful dilemma. Parental affection urges you to
        die that he may live. Self-love whispers, <span class=

        him he was obliged to abdicate the throne in favour of the infant.
        Whatever might be the king's age, his influence in the state, or the
        political situation of affairs, no sooner was the child born than the
        monarch became a subject: the infant was at once proclaimed the
        sovereign of the people: the royal name was conferred upon him, and
        his father was the first to do him homage, by saluting his feet and
        declaring him king. All matters, however, of importance which
        concerned either the internal welfare or the foreign relations of the
        country continued to be transacted by the father and his councillors;
        but every edict was issued in the name and on the behalf of the
        youthful monarch, and though the whole of the executive government
        might remain in the hands of the father, he only acted as regent for
        his son, and was regarded as such by the nation. The lands and other
        sources of revenue were appropriated to the maintenance of the infant
        ruler, his household, and his attendants; the insignia of royal
        authority were transferred to him, and his father rendered him all
        those marks of humble respect which he had hitherto exacted from his
        subjects. This custom of succession was not confined to the family of
        the sovereign, it extended also to the nobles and the landed gentry;
        they, too, had to resign their rank, honours, and possessions on the
        birth of a son. A man who but yesterday was a baron, not to be
        approached by his inferiors till they had ceremoniously bared the
        whole of the upper part of their bodies, was to-day reduced to the
        rank of a mere commoner with none to do him reverence, if in the
        night time his wife had given birth to a son, and the child had been
        suffered to live. The father indeed still continued to administer the
        estate, but he did so for the benefit of the infant, to whom it now
        belonged, and to whom all the marks of respect were at once
        transferred.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This singular
        usage becomes intelligible if the spirit of the father was supposed
        to quit him at the birth of his first son and to reappear in the
        infant. Such a belief and such a practice would, it is obvious,
        supply a powerful motive to infanticide, since a father could not
        rear his firstborn son without thereby relinquishing the honours and
        possessions to which he had been accustomed. The sacrifice was a
        heavy one, and we need not wonder if many men refused to make it.
        Certainly infanticide was practised in Polynesia to an extraordinary
        extent. The first missionaries estimated that not less than
        two-thirds of the children were murdered by their parents, and this
        estimate has been confirmed by a careful enquirer. It would seem that
        before the introduction of Christianity there was not a single mother
        in the islands who was not also a murderess, having imbrued her hands
        in the blood of her offspring. Three native women, the eldest not
        more than forty years of age, happened once to be in a room where the
        conversation turned on infanticide, and they confessed to having
        destroyed not less than twenty-one infants between them.<a id=

        this sort have left traces of themselves in Greek myth and legend.
        Cronus or Saturn, as the Romans called him, is said to have been the
        youngest son of the sky-god Uranus, and to have mutilated his father
        and reigned in his stead as king of gods and men. Afterwards he was
        warned by an oracle that he himself should be deposed by his son. To
        prevent that catastrophe Cronus swallowed his children, one after the
        other, as soon as they were born. Only the youngest of them, Zeus,
        was saved through a trick of his mother's, and in time he fulfilled
        the oracle by banishing his father and sitting on his throne. But
        Zeus in his turn was told that his wife Metis would give birth to a
        son who would supplant him in the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, to
        rid himself of his future rival he resorted to a device like that
        which his father Cronus had employed for a similar purpose. Only
        instead of waiting till the child was born and then devouring it, he
        made assurance doubly sure by swallowing his wife with the unborn
        babe in her womb.<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href=

        eating their infants in order to secure themselves against their

        a state of things in which father and son regularly plotted against
        each other. The other feature of the story, to wit the marriage of
        Oedipus with the widowed queen, his mother, fits in very well with
        the rule which has prevailed in some countries that a valid title to
        the throne is conferred by marriage with the late king's widow. That

        age when the blood-royal ran in the female line, and when the king
        was a man of another family, often a stranger and foreigner, who
        reigned only in virtue of being the consort of a native princess, and
        whose sons never succeeded him on the throne. But in process of time,
        when fathers had ceased to regard the birth of a son as a menace to
        their life, or at least to their regal power, kings would naturally
        scheme to secure the succession for their own male offspring, and
        this new practice could be reconciled with the old one by marrying
        the king's son either to his own sister or, after his father's
        decease, to his stepmother. We have seen marriage with a stepmother
        actually enjoined for this very purpose by some of the Saxon
        kings.<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href=

        for the purpose of giving the king's son the right of succession
        hitherto enjoyed, under a system of female kinship, either by the son
        of the king's sister or by the husband of the king's daughter; for
        under the new rule the heir to the throne united both these
        characters, being at once the son of the king's sister and, through
        marriage with his own sister, the husband of the king's daughter.
        Thus the custom of brother and sister marriage in royal houses marks
        a transition from female to male descent of the crown.<a id=

        ancient rule of policy which dictated such incestuous unions, and who

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the preceding
        evidence before us we may safely infer that a custom of allowing a
        king to kill his son, as a substitute or vicarious sacrifice for
        himself, would be in no way exceptional or surprising, at least in
        Semitic lands, where indeed religion seems at one time to have
        recommended or enjoined every man, as a duty that he owed to his god,
        to take the life of his eldest son. And it would be entirely in
        accordance with analogy if, long after the barbarous custom had been
        dropped by others, it continued to be observed by kings, who remain
        in many respects the representatives of a vanished world, solitary
        pinnacles that topple over the rising waste of waters under which the
        past lies buried. We have seen that in Greece two families of royal

        furnish human victims from their number down to a time when the rest
        of their fellow countrymen and countrywomen ran hardly more risk of
        being sacrificed than passengers in Cheapside at present run of being
        hurried into St. Paul's or Bow Church and immolated on the altar. A
        final mitigation of the custom would be to substitute condemned
        criminals for innocent victims. Such a substitution is known to have
        taken place in the human sacrifices annually offered in Rhodes to

        such examples before us we need not hesitate to believe that many
        tribes have felt no scruple or delicacy in observing a custom which
        tends to wipe out a single family. To attribute such scruples to them
        is to commit the common, the perpetually repeated mistake of

        standard of European civilisation. If any of my readers set out with
        the notion that all races of men think and act much in the same way
        as educated Englishmen, the evidence of superstitious belief and
        custom collected in the volumes of this work should suffice to
        disabuse him of so erroneous a prepossession.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation
        here given of the custom of killing divine persons assumes, or at
        least is readily combined with, the idea that the soul of the slain
        divinity is transmitted to his successor. Of this transmission I have
        no direct proof except in the case of the Shilluk, among whom the
        practice of killing the divine king prevails in a typical form, and
        with whom it is a fundamental article of faith that the soul of the
        divine founder of the dynasty is immanent in every one of his slain
        successors.<a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href=

        this is the only actual example of such a belief which I can adduce,
        analogy seems to render it probable that a similar succession to the
        soul of the slain god has been supposed to take place in other
        instances, though direct evidence of it is wanting. For it has been
        already shewn that the soul of the incarnate deity is often supposed
        to transmigrate at death into another incarnation;<a id="noteref_538"
        name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class=

        this takes place when the death is a natural one, there seems no
        reason why it should not take place when the death has been brought
        about by violence. Certainly the idea that the soul of a dying person
        may be transmitted to his successor is perfectly familiar to
        primitive peoples. In Nias the eldest son usually succeeds his father
        in the chieftainship. But if from any bodily or mental defect the
        eldest son is disqualified for ruling, the father determines in his
        lifetime which of his sons shall succeed him. In order, however, to
        establish his right of succession, it is necessary that the son upon
        whom his father's choice falls shall catch in his mouth or in a bag
        the last breath, and with it the soul, of the dying chief. For
        whoever catches his last breath is chief equally with the appointed
        successor. Hence the other brothers, and sometimes also strangers,
        crowd round the dying man to catch his soul as it passes. The houses
        in Nias are raised above the ground on posts, and it has <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> happened that when the dying man lay with
        his face on the floor, one of the candidates has bored a hole in the
        floor and sucked in the chief's last breath through a bamboo tube.
        When the chief has no son, his soul is caught in a bag, which is
        fastened to an image made to represent the deceased; the soul is then
        believed to pass into the image.<a id="noteref_539" name=

        the captured soul to the dead man's successor by throwing his hands
        towards and blowing upon him. The person to whom the soul was thus
        communicated took the name and rank of the deceased. On the death of
        a chief the priest thus filled a responsible and influential

        Uganda the spirit of the king who had been the last to die manifested
        itself from time to time in the person of a priest, who was prepared
        for the discharge of this exalted function by a peculiar ceremony.
        When the body of the king had been embalmed and had lain for five
        months in the tomb, which was a house built specially for it, the
        head was severed from the body and laid in an ant-hill. Having been
        stript of flesh by the insects, the skull was washed in a particular
        river (the Ndyabuworu) and filled with native beer. One of the late
        king's priests then drank the beer out of the skull and thus became
        himself a vessel meet to receive the spirit of the deceased monarch.
        The skull was afterwards replaced in the tomb, but the lower jaw was
        separated from it and deposited in a jar; and this jar, being swathed
        in bark-cloth and decorated with beads <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class=

        represented the late king. A house was built for its reception in the
        shape of a beehive and divided into two rooms, an inner and an outer.
        Any person might enter the outer room, but in the inner room the
        spirit of the dead king was supposed to dwell. In front of the
        partition was set a throne covered with lion and leopard skins, and
        fenced off from the rest of the chamber by a rail of spears, shields,
        and knives, most of them made of copper and brass, and beautifully
        worked. When the priest, who had fitted himself to receive the king's
        spirit, desired to converse with the people in the king's name, he
        went to the throne and addressing the spirit in the inner room
        informed him of the business in hand. Then he smoked one or two pipes
        of tobacco, and in a few minutes began to rave, which was a sign that
        the spirit had entered into him. In this condition he spoke with the
        voice and made known the wishes of the late king. When he had done
        so, the spirit left him and returned into the inner room, and he
        himself departed a mere man as before.<a id="noteref_549" name=

        year at the new moon of September the king of Sofala in eastern
        Africa used to perform obsequies for the kings, his predecessors, on
        the top of a high mountain, where they were buried. In the course of
        the lamentations for the dead, the soul of the king who had died last
        used to enter into a man who imitated the deceased monarch, both in
        voice and gesture. The living king conversed with this man as with
        his dead father, consulting him in regard to the affairs of the
        kingdom and receiving his oracular replies.<a id="noteref_550" name=

        examples shew that provision is often made for the ghostly succession
        of kings and chiefs. In the Hausa kingdom of Daura, in Northern
        Nigeria, where the kings used regularly to be put to death on the
        first symptoms of failing health, the new king had to step over the
        corpse of his predecessor and to be bathed in the blood of a black
        ox, the skin of which then served as a shroud for the body of the
        late king.<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes it would
        appear that the spiritual link between a king and the souls of his
        predecessors is formed by the possession of some part of their
        persons. In southern Celebes, as we have seen, the regalia often
        consist of corporeal portions of deceased rajahs, which are treasured
        as sacred relics and confer the right to the throne.<a id=

        Similarly among the Sakalavas of southern Madagascar a vertebra of
        the neck, a nail, and a lock of hair of a deceased king are placed in
        a crocodile's tooth and carefully kept along with the similar relics
        of his predecessors in a house set apart for the purpose. The
        possession of these relics constitutes the right to the throne. A
        legitimate heir who should be deprived of them would lose all his
        authority over the people, and on the contrary a usurper who should
        make himself master of the relics would be acknowledged king without
        dispute. It has sometimes happened that a relation of the reigning
        monarch has stolen the crocodile teeth with their precious contents,
        and then had himself proclaimed king. Accordingly, when the Hovas
        invaded the country, knowing the superstition of the natives, they
        paid less attention to the living king than to the relics of the

        while he at the same time offers a sacrifice and a libation with
        goat's blood, milk, and honey. He then carefully secrets the skull,
        the possession of which is understood to confirm him in power and to
        impart to him some of the wisdom of his predecessor.<a id=

        Similarly, when the Jaga or King of Cassange, in Angola, has departed
        this life, an official extracts a tooth from the deceased monarch and
        presents it to his successor, who deposits it along with the teeth of
        former kings in a box, which is the sole property of the crown and
        without which no Jaga can legitimately exercise the regal

        Sometimes, in order apparently that the new sovereign may inherit
        more surely the magical and other virtues of the royal line, he is
        required to eat a piece of his dead predecessor. Thus at Abeokuta not
        only was the head of the late king presented to his successor, but
        the tongue was cut out and given him to eat. Hence, when the natives
        wish to signify that the sovereign reigns, they say, <span class=

        cut off and sent to his nominal suzerain, the Alafin of Oyo, the
        paramount king of Yoruba land; but his heart is eaten by his

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains to
          ask what light the custom of killing the divine king or priest
          sheds upon the special subject of our enquiry. In the first part of
          this work we saw reason to suppose that the King of the Wood at
          Nemi was regarded as an incarnation of a tree-spirit or of the
          spirit of vegetation, and that as such he would be endowed, in the
          belief of his worshippers, with a magical power of making the trees
          to bear fruit, the crops to grow, and so on.<a id="noteref_562"
          name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> His
          life must therefore have been held very precious by his
          worshippers, and was probably hedged in by a system of elaborate
          precautions or taboos like those by which, in so many places, the
          life of the man-god has been guarded against the malignant
          influence of demons and sorcerers. But we have seen that the very
          value attached to the life of the man-god necessitates his violent
          death as the only means of preserving it from the inevitable decay
          of age. The same reasoning would apply to the King of the Wood; he,
          too, had to be killed in order that the divine spirit, incarnate in
          him, might be transferred in its integrity to his successor. The
          rule that he held office till a stronger should slay him might be
          supposed to secure both the preservation of his divine life in full
          vigour and its transference to a suitable successor as soon as that
          vigour began to be impaired. For so long as he could maintain his
          position by the strong hand, it might be inferred that his natural
          force was not abated; whereas his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> defeat and death at the hands of another
          proved that his strength was beginning to fail and that it was time
          his divine life should be lodged in a less dilapidated tabernacle.
          This explanation of the rule that the King of the Wood had to be
          slain by his successor at least renders that rule perfectly
          intelligible. It is strongly supported by the theory and practice
          of the Shilluk, who put their divine king to death at the first
          signs of failing health, lest his decrepitude should entail a
          corresponding failure of vital energy on the corn, the cattle, and
          men.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href=
          "#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a>
          Moreover, it is countenanced by the analogy of the Chitomé, upon
          whose life the existence of the world was supposed to hang, and who
          was therefore slain by his successor as soon as he shewed signs of
          breaking up. Again, the terms on which in later times the King of
          Calicut held office are identical with those attached to the office
          of King of the Wood, except that whereas the former might be
          assailed by a candidate at any time, the King of Calicut might only
          be attacked once every twelve years. But as the leave granted to
          the King of Calicut to reign so long as he could defend himself
          against all comers was a mitigation of the old rule which set a
          fixed term to his life,<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href=
          "#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> so we
          may conjecture that the similar permission granted to the King of
          the Wood was a mitigation of an older custom of putting him to
          death at the end of a definite period. In both cases the new rule
          gave to the god-man at least a chance for his life, which under the
          old rule was denied him; and people probably reconciled themselves
          to the change by reflecting that so long as the god-man could
          maintain himself by the sword against all assaults, there was no
          reason to apprehend that the fatal decay had set in.</p>

          water-flowers and surmounted with a nosegay of peonies. The sleeves

          water. All rejoiced when he was well drenched. Finally he waded

          Whit-Monday in white shirts and white trousers, with red scarves
          round their waists and swords hanging from the scarves. They ride
          on horseback into the wood, led by two trumpeters blowing their
          trumpets. In the wood they cut down leafy oak branches, in which
          they envelop from head to foot him who was the last of their number
          to ride out of the village. His legs, however, are encased
          separately, so that he may be able to mount <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his horse again. Further, they give him
          a long artificial neck, with an artificial head and a false face on
          the top of it. Then a May-tree is cut, generally an aspen or beech
          about ten feet high; and being decked with coloured handkerchiefs
          and ribbons it is entrusted to a special <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May-bearer.”</span> The cavalcade then returns with
          music and song to the village. Amongst the personages who figure in
          the procession are a Moorish king with a sooty face and a crown on
          his head, a Dr. Iron-Beard, a corporal, and an executioner. They
          halt on the village green, and each of the characters makes a
          speech in rhyme. The executioner announces that the leaf-clad man
          has been condemned to death, and cuts off his false head. Then the
          riders race to the May-tree, which has been set up a little way
          off. The first man who succeeds in wrenching it from the ground as
          he gallops past keeps it with all its decorations. The ceremony is

          the Erzgebirge the following custom was annually observed at
          Shrovetide about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two men
          disguised as Wild Men, the one in brushwood and moss, the other in
          straw, were led about the streets, and at last taken to the
          market-place, where they were chased up and down, shot and stabbed.
          Before falling they reeled about with strange gestures and spirted
          blood on the people <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
          209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          from bladders which they carried. When they were down the huntsmen
          placed them on boards and carried them to the ale-house, the miners
          marching beside them and winding blasts on their mining tools as if
          they had taken a noble head of game.<a id="noteref_568" name=

          very similar Shrovetide custom is still observed near Schluckenau
          in Bohemia. A man dressed up as a Wild Man is chased through
          several streets till he comes to a narrow lane across which a cord
          is stretched. He stumbles over the cord and, falling to the ground,
          is overtaken and caught by his pursuers. The executioner runs up
          and stabs with his sword a bladder filled with blood which the Wild
          Man wears round his body; so the Wild Man dies, while a stream of
          blood reddens the ground. Next day a straw-man, made up to look
          like the Wild Man, is placed on a litter, and, accompanied by a
          great crowd, is taken to a pool into which it is thrown by the
          executioner. The ceremony is called <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Semic
          (Bohemia) the custom of beheading the King is observed on
          Whit-Monday. A troop of young people disguise themselves; each is
          girt with a girdle of bark and carries a wooden sword and a trumpet
          of willow-bark. The King wears a robe of tree-bark adorned with
          flowers, on his head is a crown of bark decked with flowers and
          branches, his feet are wound about with ferns, a mask hides his
          face, and for a sceptre he has a hawthorn switch in his hand. A lad
          leads him through the village by a rope fastened to his foot, while
          the rest dance about, blow their trumpets, and whistle. In every
          farmhouse the King is chased round the room, and one of the troop,
          amid much noise and outcry strikes with his sword a blow on the
          King's robe of bark till it rings again. Then a gratuity is
          demanded.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href=

          ceremony of decapitation, which is here somewhat slurred over, is
          carried out with a greater semblance of reality in other parts of
          Bohemia. Thus in some villages of the Königgrätz district on
          Whit-Monday the girls assemble under one lime-tree and the young
          men under another, all dressed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in their best and tricked out with ribbons.
          The young men twine a garland for the Queen, and the girls another
          for the King. When they have chosen the King and Queen they all go
          in procession, two and two, to the ale-house, from the balcony of
          which the crier proclaims the names of the King and Queen. Both are
          then invested with the insignia of their office and are crowned
          with the garlands, while the music plays up. Then some one gets on
          a bench and accuses the King of various offences, such as
          ill-treating the cattle. The King appeals to witnesses and a trial
          ensues, at the close of which the judge, who carries a white wand
          as his badge of office, pronounces a verdict of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Guilty”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Not
          guilty.”</span> If the verdict is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Guilty,”</span> the judge breaks his wand, the King
          kneels on a white cloth, all heads are bared, and a soldier sets
          three or four hats, one above the other, on his Majesty's head. The
          judge then pronounces the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Guilty”</span> thrice in a loud voice, and orders the
          crier to behead the King. The crier obeys by striking off the

          some places of the Pilsen district (Bohemia) on Whit-Monday the
          King is dressed in bark, ornamented with flowers and ribbons; he
          wears a crown of gilt paper and rides a horse, which is also decked
          with flowers. Attended by a judge, an executioner, and other
          characters, and followed by a train of soldiers, all mounted, he
          rides to the village square, where a hut or arbour of green boughs
          has been erected under the May-trees, which are firs, freshly cut,
          peeled to the top, and dressed with flowers and ribbons. After the
          dames and maidens of the village have been criticised and a frog
          beheaded, in the way already described, the cavalcade rides to a
          place previously determined upon, in a straight, broad street. Here
          they draw up in two lines and the King takes to flight. He is given
          a short start and rides off at full speed, pursued by the whole
          troop. If they fail to catch him he remains King for another year,
          and his companions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg

          overtake and catch him he is scourged with hazel rods or beaten
          with the wooden swords and compelled to dismount. Then the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if these
          personages represent, as they certainly do, the spirit of
          vegetation in spring, the question arises, Why kill them? What is
          the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and
          above all in spring, when his services are most wanted? The only
          probable answer to this question seems to be given in the
          explanation already proposed of the custom of killing the divine
          king or priest. The divine life, incarnate in a material and mortal
          body, is liable to be tainted and corrupted by the weakness of the
          frail <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name=
          "Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> medium in which it
          is for a time enshrined; and if it is to be saved from the
          increasing enfeeblement which it must necessarily share with its
          human incarnation as he advances in years, it must be detached from
          him before, or at least as soon as, he exhibits signs of decay, in
          order to be transferred to a vigorous successor. This is done by
          killing the old representative of the god and conveying the divine
          spirit from him to a new incarnation. The killing of the god, that
          is, of his human incarnation, is therefore merely a necessary step
          to his revival or resurrection in a better form. Far from being an
          extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of a
          purer and stronger manifestation of it. If this explanation holds
          good of the custom of killing divine kings and priests in general,
          it is still more obviously applicable to the custom of annually
          killing the representative of the tree-spirit or spirit of
          vegetation in spring. For the decay of plant life in winter is
          readily interpreted by primitive man as an enfeeblement of the
          spirit of vegetation; the spirit has, he thinks, grown old and weak
          and must therefore be renovated by being slain and brought to life
          in a younger and fresher form. Thus the killing of the
          representative of the tree-spirit in spring is regarded as a means
          to promote and quicken the growth of vegetation. For the killing of
          the tree-spirit is associated always (we must suppose) implicitly,
          and sometimes explicitly also, with a revival or resurrection of
          him in a more youthful and vigorous form. So in the Saxon and
          Thüringen custom, after the Wild Man has been shot he is brought to
          life again by a doctor;<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href=
          "#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a> and
          in the Wurmlingen ceremony there figures a Dr. Iron-Beard, who
          probably once played a similar part; certainly in another spring
          ceremony, which will be described presently, Dr. Iron-Beard
          pretends to restore a dead man to life. But of this revival or
          resurrection of the god we shall have more to say anon.</p>

              <span style="font-size: 80%">Resemblances between these North
              European customs and the rites of Nemi.</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The points of
          similarity between these North European personages and the subject
          of our enquiry—the King of the Wood or priest of Nemi—are
          sufficiently striking. In these northern maskers we see kings,
          whose dress of bark and leaves, along with the hut of green boughs
          and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg
          213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fir-trees under which they hold their court, proclaim them
          unmistakably as, like their Italian counterpart, Kings of the Wood.
          Like him they die a violent death, but like him they may escape
          from it for a time by their bodily strength and agility; for in
          several of these northern customs the flight and pursuit of the
          king is a prominent part of the ceremony, and in one case at least
          if the king can outrun his pursuers he retains his life and his
          office for another year. In this last case the king in fact holds
          office on condition of running for his life once a year, just as
          the King of Calicut in later times held office on condition of
          defending his life against all comers once every twelve years, and
          just as the priest of Nemi held office on condition of defending
          himself against any assault at any time. In every one of these
          instances the life of the god-man is prolonged on condition of his
          shewing, in a severe physical contest of fight or flight, that his
          bodily strength is not decayed, and that, therefore, the violent
          death, which sooner or later is inevitable, may for the present be
          postponed. With regard to flight it is noticeable that flight
          figured conspicuously both in the legend and in the practice of the
          King of the Wood. He had to be a runaway slave in memory of the
          flight of Orestes, the traditional founder of the worship; hence
          the Kings of the Wood are described by an ancient writer as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“both strong of hand and fleet of
          foot.”</span><a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a>
          Perhaps if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove fully we might
          find that the king was allowed a chance for his life by flight,
          like his Bohemian brother. I have already conjectured that the
          annual flight of the priestly king at Rome (<span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">regifugium</span></span>) was at first a
          flight of the same kind; in other words, that he was originally one
          of those divine kings who are either put to death after a fixed
          period or allowed to prove by the strong hand or the fleet foot
          that their divinity is vigorous and unimpaired.<a id="noteref_579"

          more point of resemblance may be noted between the Italian King of
          the Wood and his northern counterparts. In Saxony and Thüringen the
          representative of the tree-spirit, after being killed, is brought
          to life again by a doctor. This is exactly what legend affirmed to
          have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name=
          "Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> happened to the
          first King of the Wood at Nemi, Hippolytus or Virbius, who after he
          had been killed by his horses was restored to life by the physician
          Aesculapius.<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href=
          "#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> Such
          a legend tallies well with the theory that the slaying of the King
          of the Wood was only a step to his revival or resurrection in his
          successor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
          discussion it has been assumed that the mock killing of the Wild
          Man and of the King in North European folk-custom is a modern
          substitute for an ancient custom of killing them in earnest. Those
          who best know the tenacity of life possessed by folk-custom and its
          tendency, with the growth of civilisation, to dwindle from solemn
          ritual into mere pageant and pastime, will be least likely to
          question the truth of this assumption. That human sacrifices were
          commonly offered by the ancestors of the civilised races of North
          Europe, Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, is certain.<a id="noteref_581"
          name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> It is
          not, therefore, surprising that the modern peasant should do in
          mimicry what his forefathers did in reality. We know as a matter of
          fact that in other parts of the world mock human sacrifices have
          been substituted for real ones. Thus in Minahassa, a district of
          Celebes, human victims used to be regularly sacrificed at certain
          festivals, but through Dutch influence the custom was abolished and
          a sham sacrifice substituted for it. The victim was seated in a
          chair and all the usual preparations were made for sacrificing him,
          but at the critical moment, when the chief priest had heaved up his
          flashing swords (for he wielded two of them) to deal the fatal
          stroke, his assistants sprang forward, their hands wrapt in cloths,
          to grasp and arrest the descending blades. The precaution was
          necessary, for the priest was wound up to such a pitch of
          excitement that if left alone he might have consummated
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name=
          "Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the sacrifice.
          Afterwards an effigy, made out of the stem of a banana-tree, was
          substituted for the human victim; and the blood, which might not be
          wanting, was supplied by fowls.<a id="noteref_582" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> Near
          the native town of Luba, in western Busoga, a district of central
          Africa, there is a sacred tree of the species known as <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Parinarium</span></span>. Its glossy white
          trunk shoots up to a height of a hundred feet before it sends out
          branches. The tree is surrounded by small fetish huts and curious
          arcades. Once when the dry season was drawing to an end and the new
          crops were not yet ripe, the Basoga suffered from hunger. So they
          came to the sacred tree in canoes, of which the prows were decked
          with wreaths of yellow acacia blossom and other flowers. Landing on
          the shore they stripped themselves of their clothing and wrapped
          ropes made of green creepers and leaves round their arms and necks.
          At the foot of the tree they danced to an accompaniment of song.
          Then a little girl, about ten years old, was brought and laid at
          the base of the tree as if she were to be sacrificed. Every detail
          of the sacrifice was gone through in mimicry. A slight cut was made
          in the child's neck, and she was then caught up and thrown into the
          lake, where a man stood ready to save her from drowning. By native
          custom the girl on whom this ceremony had been performed was
          dedicated to a life of perpetual virginity.<a id="noteref_583"

          Captain Bourke was informed by an old chief that the Indians of
          Arizona used to offer human sacrifices at the Feast of Fire when
          the days are shortest. The victim had his throat cut, his breast
          opened, and his heart taken out by one of the priests. This custom
          was abolished by the Mexicans, but for a long time afterwards a
          modified form of it was secretly observed as follows. The victim,
          generally a young man, had his throat cut, and blood was allowed to
          flow freely; but the medicine-men sprinkled <span class=

          proportioned to the wealth and power of the deceased. But if the
          number required is excessively great or cannot be procured, some of
          the chiefs own slaves undergo a sham sacrifice. They are told, and
          believe, that they are about to be decapitated; their heads are

          as a burnt sacrifice to appease the wrath of the offended god. For
          example, if a stranger staying in a household whose god was
          incarnate in cuttle-fish were to catch and cook one of these
          creatures, or if a member of the family had been present where a
          cuttle-fish was eaten, the family would meet in solemn conclave and
          choose a man or woman to go and lie down in a cold oven, where he
          would be covered over with leaves, just as if he were really being
          baked. While this mock sacrifice was being carried out the family
          prayed: <span class="tei tei-q">“O bald-headed Cuttle-fish! forgive
          what has been done, it was all the work of a stranger.”</span> If
          they had not thus abased themselves before the divine cuttle-fish,
          he would undoubtedly have come and been the death of somebody by
          making a cuttle-fish to grow in his inside.<a id="noteref_589"

          year to the spirit of a volcano in order that there might be no

          a priestess, who cut off the child's ears, nose, fingers, and so
          on, then consummated the sacrifice by splitting open the breast.
          The spectacle was witnessed by hundreds of people, and feasting and
          cock-fighting went on for nine days afterwards. In course of time
          the annual human victim was replaced by a wooden puppet, which was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these mock
          sacrifices of human lives we may compare mimic sacrifices of other
          kinds. In southern India, as in many parts of the world, it used to
          be customary to sacrifice joints of the fingers on certain
          occasions. Thus among the Morasas, when a grandchild was born in
          the family, the wife of the eldest son of the grandfather must have
          the last two joints of the third and fourth fingers of her right
          hand amputated at a temple of Bhairava. The amputation was
          performed by the village carpenter with a chisel. Nowadays, the
          custom having been forbidden by the English Government, the
          sacrifice is performed in mimicry. Some people stick gold or silver
          pieces with flour paste to the ends of their fingers and then cut
          or pull them off. Others tie flowers round the fingers that used to
          be amputated, and go through a pantomime of cutting the fingers by
          putting a chisel on the joint and then taking it away. Others again
          twist gold wires in the shape of rings round their fingers. These
          the carpenter removes and appropriates.<a id="noteref_599" name=

          lately to be observed. When a boy was a few weeks old the men
          assembled, and a feast was made. On the village square an awning
          was rigged up, and the child was laid on the ground under it. An
          old man then approached it, and performed the operation of
          circumcision on the infant in dumb show with his forefinger. No
          child was regarded as a full-born member of the tribe till he had
          been subjected to this rite. The natives say that real circumcision
          was never performed in their island; but as it was commonly
          practised in Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, we may assume that its
          imitation in Niué was a substitute, introduced at some time or
          other, for the actual operation.<a id="noteref_600" name=

          Similarly when an adult Hindoo joins the sect of the Daira or
          Mahadev Mohammedans in Mysore, a mock rite of circumcision is
          performed on him instead of the real operation. A betel leaf is
          wrapped round the male member of the neophyte and the loose end of
          the leaf is snipped off instead of the prepuce.<a id="noteref_601"

          be no more than probable; our scanty knowledge of the custom and of
          its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name=

          to be more. But its probability will be augmented in proportion to
          the extent to which the motives and modes of thought which it
          assumes can be proved to have operated in primitive society.
          Hitherto the god with whose death and resurrection we have been
          chiefly concerned has been the tree-god. But if I can shew that the
          custom of killing the god and the belief in his resurrection
          originated, or at least existed, in the hunting and pastoral stage
          of society, when the slain god was an animal, and that it survived
          into the agricultural stage, when the slain god was the corn or a
          human being representing the corn, the probability of my
          explanation will have been considerably increased. This I shall
          attempt to do in the sequel, and in the course of the discussion I
          hope to clear up some obscurities which still remain, and to answer

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We start from
          the point at which we left off—the spring customs of European
          peasantry. Besides the ceremonies already described there are two
          kindred sets of observances in which the simulated death of a
          divine or supernatural being is a conspicuous feature. In one of
          them the being whose death is dramatically represented is a
          personification of the Carnival; in the other it is Death himself.
          The former ceremony falls naturally at the end of the Carnival,
          either on the last day of that merry season, namely Shrove Tuesday,
          or on the first day of Lent, namely Ash Wednesday. The date of the
          other ceremony—the Carrying or Driving out of Death, as it is
          commonly called—is not so uniformly fixed. Generally it is the
          fourth Sunday in Lent, which hence goes by the name of Dead Sunday;
          but in some places the celebration falls a week earlier, in others,
          as among the Czechs of Bohemia, a week later, while in certain
          German villages of Moravia it is held on the first Sunday after
          Easter. Perhaps, as has been suggested, the date may originally
          have been variable, depending on the appearance of the first
          swallow or some other herald of the spring. Some writers regard the
          ceremony as Slavonic in its origin. Grimm thought it was a festival
          of the New Year with the old Slavs, who began <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Frosinone, in
          Latium, about half-way between Rome and Naples, the dull monotony
          of life in a provincial Italian town is agreeably broken on the
          last day of the Carnival by the ancient festival known as the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Radica</span></span>. About four o'clock in
          the afternoon the town band, playing lively tunes and followed by a
          great crowd, proceeds to the Piazza del Plebiscito, where is the
          Sub-Prefecture as well as the rest of the Government buildings.
          Here, in the middle of the square, the eyes of the expectant
          multitude are greeted by the sight of an immense car decked with
          many-coloured festoons and drawn by four horses. Mounted on the car
          is a huge chair, on which sits enthroned the majestic figure of the
          Carnival, a man of stucco about nine feet high with a rubicund and
          smiling countenance. Enormous boots, a tin helmet like those which
          grace the heads of officers of the Italian marine, and a coat of
          many colours embellished with strange devices, adorn the outward
          man of this stately personage. His left hand rests on the arm of
          the chair, while with his right he gracefully salutes the crowd,
          being moved to this act of civility by a string which is pulled by
          a man who modestly shrinks from publicity under the mercy-seat. And
          now the crowd, surging excitedly round the car, gives vent to its
          feelings in wild cries of joy, gentle and simple being mixed up
          together and all dancing furiously the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Saltarello</span></span>. A special feature of
          the festival is that every one must carry in his hand what is
          called a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">radica</span></span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“root”</span>), by which is meant a huge leaf of the
          aloe or rather the agave. Any one who ventured into the crowd
          without <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
          223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          such a leaf would be unceremoniously hustled out of it, unless
          indeed he bore as a substitute a large cabbage at the end of a long
          stick or a bunch of grass curiously plaited. When the multitude,
          after a short turn, has escorted the slow-moving car to the gate of
          the Sub-Prefecture, they halt, and the car, jolting over the uneven
          ground, rumbles into the courtyard. A hush now falls on the crowd,
          their subdued voices sounding, according to the description of one
          who has heard them, like the murmur of a troubled sea. All eyes are
          turned anxiously to the door from which the Sub-Prefect himself and
          the other representatives of the majesty of the law are expected to
          issue and pay their homage to the hero of the hour. A few moments
          of suspense and then a storm of cheers and hand-clapping salutes
          the appearance of the dignitaries, as they file out and, descending
          the staircase, take their place in the procession. The hymn of the
          Carnival is now thundered out, after which, amid a deafening roar,
          aloe leaves and cabbages are whirled aloft and descend impartially
          on the heads of the just and the unjust, who lend fresh zest to the
          proceedings by engaging in a free fight. When these preliminaries
          have been concluded to the satisfaction of all concerned, the
          procession gets under weigh. The rear is brought up by a cart laden
          with barrels of wine and policemen, the latter engaged in the

          most internecine struggle, accompanied by a copious discharge of

          cart's tail in their anxiety not to miss the glorious opportunity
          of intoxicating themselves at the public expense. Finally, after
          the procession has paraded the principal streets in this majestic
          manner, the effigy of Carnival is taken to the middle of a public
          square, stripped of his finery, laid on a pile of wood, and burnt
          amid the cries of the multitude, who thundering out once more the
          song of the Carnival fling their so-called <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Abruzzi a
          pasteboard figure of the Carnival is carried by four grave-diggers
          with pipes in their mouths and bottles of wine slung at their
          shoulder-belts. In front walks the wife of the Carnival, dressed in
          mourning and dissolved in tears. From time to time the company
          halts, and while the wife addresses the sympathising public, the
          grave-diggers refresh the inner man with a pull at the bottle. In
          the open square the mimic corpse is laid on a pyre, and to the roll
          of drums, the shrill screams of the women, and the gruffer cries of
          the men a light is set to it. While the figure burns, chestnuts are
          thrown about among the crowd. Sometimes the Carnival is represented
          by a straw-man at the top of a pole which is borne through the town
          by a troop of mummers in the course of the afternoon. When evening
          comes on, four of the mummers hold out a quilt or sheet by the
          corners, and the figure of the Carnival is made to tumble into it.
          The procession is then resumed, the performers weeping crocodile
          tears and emphasising the poignancy of their grief by the help of
          saucepans and dinner bells. Sometimes, again, in the Abruzzi the
          dead Carnival is personified by a living man who lies in a coffin,
          attended by another who acts the priest and dispenses holy water in
          great profusion from a bathing tub.<a id="noteref_604" name=

          Malta the death of the Carnival used to be mourned by women on the
          last day of the merry festival. Clad from head to foot in black
          mantles, they carried through the streets of the city the linen
          effigy of a corpse, stuffed with straw or hay and decked with
          leaves and oranges. As they carried it, they chanted dirges,

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Lerida, in
          Catalonia, the funeral of the Carnival was witnessed by an English
          traveller in 1877. On the last Sunday of the Carnival a grand
          procession of infantry, cavalry, and maskers of many sorts, some on
          horseback and some in carriages, escorted the grand car of His
          Grace Pau Pi, as the effigy was called, in triumph through the
          principal streets. For three days the revelry ran high, and then at
          midnight on the last day of the Carnival the same procession again
          wound through the streets, but under a different aspect and for a
          different end. The triumphal car was exchanged for a hearse, in
          which reposed the effigy of his dead Grace: a troop of maskers, who
          in the first procession had played the part of Students of Folly
          with many a merry quip and jest, now, robed as priests and bishops,
          paced slowly along holding aloft huge lighted tapers and singing a
          dirge. All the mummers wore crape, and all the horsemen carried
          blazing flambeaux. Down the high street, between the lofty,
          many-storeyed and balconied houses, where every window, every
          balcony, every housetop was crammed with a dense mass of
          spectators, all dressed and masked in fantastic gorgeousness, the
          procession took its melancholy way. Over the scene flashed and
          played the shifting cross-lights and shadows from the moving
          torches: red and blue Bengal lights flared up and died out again;
          and above the trampling of the horses and the measured tread of the
          marching multitude rose the voices of the priests chanting the
          requiem, while the military bands struck in with the solemn roll of
          the muffled drums. On reaching the principal square the procession
          halted, a burlesque funeral oration was pronounced over the defunct
          Pau Pi, and the lights were extinguished. Immediately the devil and
          his angels darted from the crowd, seized the body and fled away
          with it, hotly pursued by the whole multitude, yelling, screaming,
          and cheering. Naturally the fiends were overtaken and dispersed;
          and the sham corpse, rescued from their clutches, was laid in a
          grave that had been made ready for its <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A ceremony of
          the same sort is observed in Provence on Ash Wednesday. An effigy
          called Caramantran, whimsically attired, is drawn in a chariot or
          borne on a litter, accompanied by the populace in grotesque
          costumes, who carry gourds full of wine and drain them with all the
          marks, real or affected, of intoxication. At the head of the
          procession are some men disguised as judges and barristers, and a
          tall gaunt personage who masquerades as Lent; behind them follow
          young people mounted on miserable hacks and attired as mourners who
          pretend to bewail the fate that is in store for Caramantran. In the
          principal square the procession halts, the tribunal is constituted,
          and Caramantran placed at the bar. After a formal trial he is
          sentenced to death amid the groans of the mob; the barrister who
          defended him embraces his client for the last time: the officers of
          justice do their duty: the condemned is set with his back to a wall
          and hurried into eternity under a shower of stones. The sea or a
          river receives his mangled remains.<a id="noteref_607" name=

          Throughout nearly the whole of the Ardennes it was and still is
          customary on Ash Wednesday to burn an effigy which is supposed to
          represent the Carnival, while appropriate verses are sung round
          about the blazing figure. Very often an attempt is made to fashion
          the effigy in the likeness of the husband who is reputed to be
          least faithful to his wife of any in the village. As might perhaps
          have been anticipated, the distinction of being selected for
          portraiture under these painful circumstances has a slight tendency
          to breed domestic jars, especially when the portrait is burnt in
          front of the house <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
          227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the gay deceiver whom it represents, while a powerful chorus of
          caterwauls, groans, and other melodious sounds bears public
          testimony to the opinion which his friends and neighbours entertain
          of his private virtues. In some villages of the Ardennes a young
          man of flesh and blood, dressed up in hay and straw, used to act
          the part of Shrove Tuesday (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Mardi
          Gras</span></span>), as the personification of the Carnival is
          often called in France after the last day of the period which he
          personates. He was brought before a mock tribunal, and being
          condemned to death was placed with his back to a wall, like a
          soldier at a military execution, and fired at with blank
          cartridges. At Vrigne-aux-Bois one of these harmless buffoons,
          named Thierry, was accidentally killed by a wad that had been left
          in a musket of the firing-party. When poor Shrove Tuesday dropped
          under the fire, the applause was loud and long, he did it so
          naturally; but when he did not get up again, they ran to him and
          found him a corpse. Since then there have been no more of these
          mock executions in the Ardennes.<a id="noteref_609" name=
          "noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a> In
          Franche-Comté people used to make an effigy of Shrove Tuesday on
          Ash Wednesday, and carry it about the streets to the accompaniment
          of songs. Then they brought it to the public square, where the
          offender was tried in front of the town-hall. Judges muffled in old
          red curtains and holding big books in their hands pronounced
          sentence of death. The mode of execution varied with the place.
          Sometimes it was burning, sometimes drowning, sometimes
          decapitation. In the last case the effigy was provided with tubes
          of blood, which spouted gore at the critical moment, making a
          profound impression on the minds of children, some of whom wept
          bitterly at the sight. Meantime the onlookers uttered piercing
          cries and appeared to be plunged in the deepest grief. The
          proceedings generally wound up in the evening with a ball, which
          the young married people were obliged to provide for the public
          entertainment; otherwise their slumbers were apt to be disturbed by
          the discordant notes of a cat's concert chanted under their
          windows.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Normandy on
          the evening of Ash Wednesday it used to be the custom to hold a
          celebration called the Burial of Shrove Tuesday. A squalid effigy
          scantily clothed in rags, a battered old hat crushed down on his
          dirty face, his great round paunch stuffed with straw, represented
          the disreputable old rake who after a long course of dissipation
          was now about to suffer for his sins. Hoisted on the shoulders of a
          sturdy fellow, who pretended to stagger under the burden, this
          popular personification of the Carnival promenaded the streets for
          the last time in a manner the reverse of triumphal. Preceded by a
          drummer and accompanied by a jeering rabble, among whom the urchins
          and all the tag-rag and bobtail of the town mustered in great
          force, the figure was carried about by the flickering light of
          torches to the discordant din of shovels and tongs, pots and pans,
          horns and kettles, mingled with hootings, groans, and hisses. From
          time to time the procession halted, and a champion of morality
          accused the broken-down old sinner of all the excesses he had
          committed and for which he was now about to be burned alive. The
          culprit, having nothing to urge in his own defence, was thrown on a
          heap of straw, a torch was put to it, and a great blaze shot up, to
          the delight of the children who frisked round it screaming out some
          old popular verses about the death of the Carnival. Sometimes the
          effigy was rolled down the slope of a hill before being
          burnt.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href=
          "#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a> At
          Saint-Lô the ragged effigy of Shrove Tuesday was followed by his
          widow, a big burly lout dressed as a woman with a crape veil, who
          emitted sounds of lamentation and woe in a stentorian voice. After
          being carried about the streets on a litter attended by a crowd of
          maskers, the figure was thrown into the River Vire. The final scene
          has been graphically described by Madame Octave Feuillet as she
          witnessed it in her childhood some fifty years ago. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My parents invited friends to see, from the top of the
          tower of Jeanne Couillard, the funeral procession passing. It was
          there that, quaffing lemonade—the only refreshment allowed because
          of the fast—we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg
          229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          witnessed at nightfall a spectacle of which I shall always preserve
          a lively recollection. At our feet flowed the Vire under its old
          stone bridge. On the middle of the bridge lay the figure of Shrove
          Tuesday on a litter of leaves, surrounded by scores of maskers
          dancing, singing, and carrying torches. Some of them in their
          motley costumes ran along the parapet like fiends. The rest, worn
          out with their revels, sat on the posts and dozed. Soon the dancing
          stopped, and some of the troop, seizing a torch, set fire to the
          effigy, after which they flung it into the river with redoubled
          shouts and clamour. The man of straw, soaked with resin, floated
          away burning down the stream of the Vire, lighting up with its
          funeral fires the woods on the bank and the battlements of the old
          castle in which Louis XI. and Francis I. had slept. When the last
          glimmer of the blazing phantom had vanished, like a falling star,
          at the end of the valley, every one withdrew, crowd and maskers
          alike, and we quitted the ramparts with our guests. As we returned
          home my father sang gaily the old popular song:—</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Upper
          Brittany the burial of Shrove Tuesday or the Carnival is sometimes
          performed in a ceremonious manner. Four young fellows carry a
          straw-man or one of their companions, and are followed by a funeral
          procession. A show is made of depositing the pretended corpse in
          the grave, after which the bystanders make believe to mourn, crying
          out in melancholy tones, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! my poor
          little Shrove Tuesday!”</span> The boy who played the part of
          Shrove Tuesday bears the name for the whole year.<a id=

          straw-man, covered with rags, after he had been promenaded about
          the town. He was followed by a representative of Shrove Tuesday
          clothed with sardines and cods' tails.<a id="noteref_614" name=

          Saintonge and Aunis, which correspond roughly to the modern

          beginning of Lent in England was formerly marked by a custom which
          has now fallen into disuse. A figure, made up of straw and cast-off
          clothes, was drawn or carried through the streets amid much noise
          and merriment; after which it was either burnt, shot at, or thrown
          down a chimney. This image went by the name of Jack o' Lent, and
          was by some supposed to represent Judas Iscariot.<a id=

          following Swabian form is obviously similar. In the neighbourhood
          of Tübingen on Shrove Tuesday a straw-man, called the Shrovetide
          Bear, is made up; he is dressed in a pair of old trousers, and a
          fresh black-pudding or two squirts filled with blood are inserted
          in his neck. After a formal condemnation he is beheaded, laid in a
          coffin, and on Ash Wednesday is buried in the churchyard. This is
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying the Carnival.”</span><a id=

          Amongst some of the Saxons of Transylvania the Carnival is hanged.
          Thus at Braller on Ash Wednesday or Shrove Tuesday two white and
          two chestnut horses draw a sledge on which is placed a straw-man
          swathed in a white cloth; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg
          231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          beside him is a cart-wheel which is kept turning round. Two lads
          disguised as old men follow the sledge lamenting. The rest of the
          village lads, mounted on horseback and decked with ribbons,
          accompany the procession, which is headed by two girls crowned with
          evergreen and drawn in a waggon or sledge. A trial is held under a
          tree, at which lads disguised as soldiers pronounce sentence of
          death. The two old men try to rescue the straw-man and to fly with
          him, but to no purpose; he is caught by the two girls and handed
          over to the executioner, who hangs him on a tree. In vain the old
          men try to climb up the tree and take him down; they always tumble
          down, and at last in despair they throw themselves on the ground
          and weep and howl for the hanged man. An official then makes a
          speech in which he declares that the Carnival was condemned to
          death because he had done them harm, by wearing out their shoes and
          making them tired and sleepy.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621"

          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Burial of Carnival”</span> in
          Lechrain, a man dressed as a woman in black clothes is carried on a
          litter or bier by four men; he is lamented over by men disguised as
          women in black clothes, then thrown down before the village
          dung-heap, drenched with water, buried in the dung-heap, and
          covered with straw.<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href=

          Similarly in Schörzingen, near Schömberg, the <span class=

          about the village on a bier, preceded by a man dressed in white,
          and followed by a devil who was dressed in black and carried
          chains, which he clanked. One of the train collected gifts. After
          the procession the Fool was buried under straw and dung.<a id=

          Rottweil the <span class="tei tei-q">“Carnival Fool”</span> is made
          drunk on Ash Wednesday and buried under straw amid loud

          He dances to the flute. Then on Ash Wednesday a straw-man is made,
          placed on a trough, carried out of the village to the sound of
          drums and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
          232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          mournful music, and buried in a field.<a id="noteref_625" name=

          Altdorf and Weingarten on Ash Wednesday the Fool, represented by a
          straw-man, is carried about and then thrown into the water to the
          accompaniment of melancholy music. In other villages of Swabia the
          part of fool is played by a live person, who is thrown into the
          water after being carried about in procession.<a id="noteref_626"
          name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> At
          Balwe, in Westphalia, a straw-man is made on Shrove Tuesday and
          thrown into the river amid rejoicings. This is called, as usual,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying the Carnival.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a> At
          Burgebrach, in Bavaria, it used to be customary, as a public
          pastime, to hold a sort of court of justice on Ash Wednesday. The
          accused was a straw-man, on whom was laid the burden of all the
          notorious transgressions that had been committed in the course of
          the year. Twelve chosen maidens sat in judgment and pronounced
          sentence, and a single advocate pleaded the cause of the public
          scapegoat. Finally the effigy was burnt, and thus all the offences
          that had created a scandal in the community during the year were
          symbolically atoned for. We can hardly doubt that this custom of
          burning a straw-man on Ash Wednesday for the sins of a whole year
          is only another form of the custom, observed on the same day in so
          many other places, of burning an effigy which is supposed to embody
          and to be responsible for all the excesses committed during the
          licence of the Carnival.</p>

          ceremony of the same sort was witnessed at Pylos by Mr. E. L.
          Tilton in 1895. On the evening of the first day of the Greek Lent,
          which fell that year on the twenty-fifth of February, an effigy
          with a grotesque mask for a face was borne about the streets on a
          bier, preceded by a mock priest with long white beard. Other
          functionaries surrounded the bier and two torch-bearers walked in
          advance. The procession moved slowly to melancholy music played by
          a pipe and drum. A final halt was made in the public square, where
          a circular space was kept clear of the surging crowd. Here a
          bonfire was kindled, and round it the priest led a wild dance to
          the same droning music. When the frenzy was at <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> its height, the chief performer put tow
          on the effigy and set fire to it, and while it blazed he resumed
          his mad career, brandishing torches and tearing off his venerable
          beard to add fuel to the flames.<a id="noteref_628" name=

          figure is stuck on a long pole, carried across the boundary of the
          village with loud cries of joy, and fastened to the top of a tree
          in the wood. The ceremony is believed to be a protection against

          Shrove Tuesday Dr. Iron-Beard professes to bleed a sick man, who
          thereupon falls as dead to the ground; but the doctor at last
          restores him to life by blowing air into him through a tube.<a id=

          delivered and then the people return to the village-green or
          meeting-place, where they smoke the long clay pipes which are
          distributed at funerals. On the morning of Shrove Tuesday in the

          generally followed by a ceremony, or at least accompanied by a
          profession, of bringing in Summer, Spring, or Life. Thus in Middle
          Franken, a province of Bavaria, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, the
          village urchins used to make a straw effigy of Death, which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name=

          Frankish custom is thus described by a writer of the sixteenth
          century: <span class="tei tei-q">“At Mid-Lent, the season when the
          church bids us rejoice, the young people of my native country make
          a straw image of Death, and fastening it to a pole carry it with
          shouts to the neighbouring villages. By some they are kindly
          received, and after being refreshed with milk, peas, and dried
          pears, the usual food of that season, are sent home again. Others,
          however, treat them with anything but hospitality; for, looking on
          them as harbingers of misfortune, to wit of death, they drive them
          from their boundaries with weapons and insults.”</span><a id=

          the villages near Erlangen, when the fourth Sunday in Lent came
          round, the peasant girls used to dress themselves in all their
          finery with flowers in their hair. Thus attired they repaired to
          the neighbouring town, carrying puppets which were adorned with
          leaves and covered with white cloths. These they took from house to
          house in pairs, stopping at every door where they expected to
          receive something, and singing a few lines in which they announced
          that it was Mid-Lent and that they were about to throw Death into
          the water. When they had collected some trifling gratuities they
          went to the river Regnitz and flung the puppets representing Death
          into the stream. This was done to ensure a fruitful and prosperous
          year; further, it was considered a safeguard against pestilence and
          sudden death.<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href=

          Nuremberg girls of seven to eighteen years of age go through the
          streets bearing a little open coffin, in which is a doll hidden
          under a shroud. Others carry a beech branch, with an apple fastened
          to it for a head, in an open box. They sing, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We carry Death into the water, it is well,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We carry Death into the water, carry him

          other parts of Bavaria the ceremony took place on the Saturday
          before the fifth Sunday in Lent, and the performers were boys or
          girls, according to the sex of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          figure was thrown into water or buried in a secret place, for

          again. Then early on Sunday morning the children went from house to

          Death was gone.<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some villages
          of Thüringen, on the fourth Sunday of Lent, the children used to
          carry a puppet of birchen twigs through the village, and then threw
          it into a pool, while they sang, <span class="tei tei-q">“We carry
          the old Death out behind the herdsman's old house; we have got
          Summer, and Kroden's (?) power is destroyed.”</span><a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> At
          Debschwitz or Dobschwitz, near Gera, the ceremony of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Driving out Death”</span> is or was annually observed
          on the first of March. The young people make up a figure of straw
          or the like materials, dress it in old clothes, which they have
          begged from houses in the village, and carry it out and throw it
          into the river. On returning to the village they break the good
          news to the people, and receive eggs and other victuals as a
          reward. The ceremony is or was supposed to purify the village and
          to protect the inhabitants from sickness and plague. In other
          villages of Thüringen, in which the population was originally
          Slavonic, the carrying out of the puppet is accompanied with the
          singing of a song, which begins, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we
          carry Death out of the village and Spring into the
          village.”</span><a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href=
          "#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a> At
          the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century
          the custom was observed in Thüringen as follows. The boys and girls
          made an effigy of straw or the like materials, but the shape of the
          figure varied from year to year. In one year it would represent an
          old man, in the next an old woman, in the third a young man, and in
          the fourth a maiden, and the dress of the figure varied with the
          character <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg
          236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          it personated. There used to be a sharp contest as to where the
          effigy was to be made, for the people thought that the house from
          which it was carried forth would not be visited with death that
          year. Having been made, the puppet was fastened to a pole and
          carried by a girl if it represented an old man, but by a boy if it
          represented an old woman. Thus it was borne in procession, the
          young people holding sticks in their hands and singing that they
          were driving out Death. When they came to water they threw the
          effigy into it and ran hastily back, fearing that it might jump on
          their shoulders and wring their necks. They also took care not to
          touch it, lest it should dry them up. On their return they beat the
          cattle with the sticks, believing that this would make the animals
          fat or fruitful. Afterwards they visited the house or houses from
          which they had carried the image of Death, where they received a
          dole of half-boiled peas.<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640"
          href="#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> The
          custom of <span class="tei tei-q">“Carrying out Death”</span> was
          practised also in Saxony. At Leipsic the bastards and public women
          used to make a straw effigy of Death every year at Mid-Lent. This
          they carried through all the streets with songs and shewed it to
          the young married women. Finally they threw it into the river
          Parthe. By this ceremony they professed to make the young wives
          fruitful, to purify the city, and to protect the inhabitants for
          that year from plague and other epidemics.<a id="noteref_641" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ceremonies of
          the same sort are observed at Mid-Lent in Silesia. Thus in many
          places the grown girls with the help of the young men dress up a
          straw figure with women's clothes and carry it out of the village
          towards the setting sun. At the boundary they strip it of its
          clothes, tear it in pieces, and scatter the fragments about the
          fields. This is called <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying
          Death.”</span> As they carry the image out, they sing that they are
          about to bury death under an oak, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> he may depart from the people. Sometimes the
          song runs that they are bearing death over hill and dale to return
          no more. In the Polish neighbourhood of Gross-Strehlitz the puppet
          is called Goik. It is carried on horseback and thrown into the
          nearest water. The people think that the ceremony protects them
          from sickness of every sort in the coming year. In the districts of
          Wohlau and Guhrau the image of Death used to be thrown over the
          boundary of the next village. But as the neighbours feared to
          receive the ill-omened figure, they were on the look-out to repel
          it, and hard knocks were often exchanged between the two parties.
          In some Polish parts of Upper Silesia the effigy, representing an
          old woman, goes by the name of Marzana, the goddess of death. It is
          made in the house where the last death occurred, and is carried on
          a pole to the boundary of the village, where it is thrown into a
          pond or burnt. At Polkwitz the custom of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Carrying out Death”</span> fell into abeyance; but an
          outbreak of fatal sickness which followed the intermission of the
          ceremony induced the people to resume it.<a id="noteref_642" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> Some
          of the Moravians of Silesia make three puppets on this occasion:
          one represents a man, another a bride, and the third a bridesmaid.
          The first is carried by the boys, the two last by the girls.
          Formerly these effigies were torn to pieces at a brook; now they
          are brought home again.<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href=

          and bridegroom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some German
          villages of Moravia, as in Jassnitz and Seitendorf, the young folk
          assemble on the third Sunday in Lent and fashion a straw-man, who
          is generally adorned with a fur cap and a pair of old leathern
          hose, if such are to be had. The effigy is then hoisted on a pole
          and carried by the lads and lasses out into the open fields. On the
          way they sing a song, in which it is said that they are carrying
          Death away and bringing dear Summer into the house, and with Summer
          the May and the flowers. On reaching an appointed place they dance
          in a circle round the effigy with loud shouts and screams, then
          suddenly rush at it and tear it to pieces with their hands. Lastly,
          the pieces are thrown together in a heap, the pole is broken, and
          fire is set to the whole. While it burns the troop dances merrily
          round it, rejoicing at the victory won by Spring; and when the fire
          has nearly died out they go to the householders to beg for a
          present of eggs wherewith to hold a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The preceding
          evidence shews that the effigy of Death is often regarded with fear
          and treated with marks of hatred and abhorrence. Thus the anxiety
          of the villagers to transfer the figure from their own to their
          neighbours' land, and the reluctance of the latter to receive the
          ominous guest, are proof enough of the dread which it inspires.
          Further, in Lusatia and Silesia the puppet is sometimes made to
          look in at the window of a house, and it is believed that some one
          in the house will die within the year unless his life is redeemed
          by the payment of money.<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648"

          Again, after throwing the effigy away, the bearers sometimes run
          home lest Death should follow them, and if one of them falls in
          running, it is believed that he will die within the year.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a> At
          Chrudim, in Bohemia, the figure of Death is made out of a cross,
          with a head and mask stuck at the top, and a shirt stretched out on
          it. On the fifth Sunday in Lent the boys take this effigy to the
          nearest brook or pool, and standing in a line throw it into the
          water. Then they all plunge in after it; but as soon as it is
          caught no one more may enter the water. The boy who did not enter
          the water or entered it last will die within the year, and he is
          obliged to carry the Death back to the village. The effigy is then
          burned.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href=

          the other hand, it is believed that no one will die within the year
          in the house out of which the figure of Death has been
          carried;<a id="noteref_651" name="noteref_651" href=

          the village out of which Death has been driven is sometimes
          supposed to be protected against sickness and plague.<a id=

          some villages of Austrian Silesia on the Saturday before Dead
          Sunday an effigy is made of old clothes, hay, and straw, for the
          purpose of driving Death out of the village. On Sunday the people,
          armed with sticks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg
          240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and straps, assemble before the house where the figure is lodged.
          Four lads then draw the effigy by cords through the village amid
          exultant shouts, while all the others beat it with their sticks and
          straps. On reaching a field which belongs to a neighbouring village
          they lay down the figure, cudgel it soundly, and scatter the
          fragments over the field. The people believe that the village from
          which Death has been thus carried out will be safe from any
          infectious disease for the whole year.<a id="noteref_653" name=

          of the village was dragged out and sawn in two, amid a prodigious

          Palermo the representation used to be still more lifelike. At
          Mid-Lent an old woman was drawn through the streets on a cart,
          attended by two men dressed in the costume of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Compagnia de'
          Bianchi</span></span>, a society or religious order whose function
          it was to attend and console prisoners condemned to death. A
          scaffold was erected in a public square; the old woman mounted it,
          and two mock executioners proceeded, amid a storm of huzzas and
          hand-clapping, to saw through her neck, or rather through a bladder
          of blood which had been previously fitted to it. The blood gushed
          out and the old woman pretended to swoon and die. The last of these
          mock executions took place in 1737.<a id="noteref_657" name=

          the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Old Woman was
          represented by a figure stuffed with walnuts and dried figs and
          fastened to the top of a ladder. At Mid-Lent this effigy was sawn
          through the middle under the <span lang="it" class=

          as the dried fruits tumbled out they were scrambled for by the
          crowd. A trace of the custom is still to be seen in the practice,
          observed by urchins, of secretly pinning paper ladders to the
          shoulders of women of the lower classes who happen to shew
          themselves in the streets on the morning of Mid-Lent.<a id=

          similar custom is observed by urchins in Rome; and at Naples on the
          first of April boys cut strips of cloth into the shape of saws,
          smear them with gypsum, and strike passers-by with their "saws" on
          the back, thus imprinting the figure of a saw upon their

          made of cane and jeer at old people, who therefore generally stay
          indoors on that day. The Calabrian women meet together at this time
          and feast on figs, chestnuts, honey, and so forth; this they call
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sawing the Old Woman”</span>—a
          reminiscence probably of a custom like the old Florentine
          one.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href=

          themselves of the original, they make a puppet representing her,
          which in the evening is consumed on a bonfire. On the Lake of Garda

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Berry, a
          region of central France, the custom of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sawing the Old Woman”</span> at Mid-Lent used to be
          popular, and has probably not wholly died out even now. Here the
          name of <span class="tei tei-q">“Fairs of the old Wives”</span> was
          given to certain fairs held in Lent, at which children were made to
          believe that they would see the Old Woman of Mid-Lent split or sawn
          asunder. At Argenton and Cluis-Dessus, when Mid-Lent has come,
          children of ten or twelve years of age scour the streets with
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name=
          "Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> wooden swords,
          pursue the old crones whom they meet, and even try to break into
          the houses where ancient dames are known to live. Passers-by, who
          see the children thus engaged, say, <span class="tei tei-q">“They
          are going to cut or sabre the Old Woman.”</span> Meantime the old
          wives take care to keep out of sight as much as possible. When the
          children of Cluis-Dessus have gone their rounds, and the day draws
          towards evening, they repair to Cluis-Dessous, where they mould a
          rude figure of an old woman out of clay, hew it in pieces with
          their wooden swords, and throw the bits into the river. At Bourges
          on the same day, an effigy representing an old woman was formerly
          sawn in two on the crier's stone in a public square. About the
          middle of the nineteenth century, in the same town and on the same
          day, hundreds of children assembled at the Hospital <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to see the old woman split or divided in two.”</span>
          A religious service was held in the building on this occasion,
          which attracted many idlers. In the streets it was not uncommon to
          hear cries of <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us cleave the Old Wife!
          let us cleave the oldest woman of the ward!”</span> At Tulle, on
          the day of Mid-Lent, the people used to enquire after the oldest
          woman in the town, and to tell the children that at mid-day
          punctually she was to be sawn in two at Puy-Saint-Clair.<a id=

          the fourth Sunday in Lent boys run about the streets, some with
          saws, others with billets of wood, others again with cloths in

          that they are looking for the oldest woman of the city for the
          purpose of sawing her in two in honour of Mid-Lent; at last,
          pretending to have found her, they saw something in two and burn

          in two by a young man and a maiden, both of whom wear a disguise.
          While the effigy is being sawn through, the rest of the company
          dance round it singing songs of various sorts. The remains of the
          figure are finally burnt, and the ashes thrown into a stream. The
          ceremony is supposed by the gypsies themselves to be observed in
          honour of a certain Shadow Queen; hence Palm Sunday goes by the
          name Shadow Day among all the strolling gypsies of eastern and
          southern Europe. According to the popular belief, this Shadow
          Queen, of whom the gypsies of to-day have only a very vague and
          confused conception, vanishes underground at the appearance of
          spring, but comes forth again at the beginning of winter to plague
          mankind during that inclement season with sickness, hunger, and
          death. Among the vagrant gypsies of southern Hungary the effigy is
          regarded as an expiatory and thank offering made to the Shadow
          Queen for having spared the people during the winter. In
          Transylvania the gypsies who live in tents clothe the puppet in the
          cast-off garments of the woman who has last become a widow. The
          widow herself gives the clothes gladly for this purpose, because
          she thinks that being burnt they will pass into the possession of
          her departed husband, who will thus have no excuse for returning
          from the spirit-land to visit her. The ashes are thrown by the
          Transylvanian gypsies on the first graveyard that they pass on
          their journey.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href=

          the equivalence of the effigy of the Old Woman to the effigy of
          Death in the customs we have just been considering comes out very
          clearly, thus strongly confirming the opinion of Grimm that the
          practice of <span class="tei tei-q">“sawing the Old Woman”</span>
          is only another form of the practice of <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same perhaps
          may be said of a somewhat different form which the custom assumes
          in parts of Spain and Italy. In Spain it is sometimes usual on Ash
          Wednesday to fashion an effigy of stucco or pasteboard representing
          a hideous old woman with seven legs, wearing a crown of sorrel and
          spinach, and holding a sceptre in her hand. The seven skinny legs
          stand for the seven weeks of the Lenten fast which begins on Ash
          Wednesday. This monster, proclaimed Queen of Lent amid the chanting
          of lugubrious songs, is carried in triumph through the crowded
          streets and public places. On reaching the principal square the
          people put out their torches, cease shouting, and disperse. Their
          revels are now ended, and they take a vow to hold no more merry
          meetings until all the legs of the old woman have fallen one by one
          and she has been beheaded. The effigy is then deposited in some
          place appointed for the purpose, where the public is admitted to
          see it during the whole of Lent. Every week, on Saturday evening,
          one of the Queen's legs is pulled off; and on Holy Saturday, when
          from every church tower the joyous clangour of the bells proclaims
          the glad tidings that Christ is risen, the mutilated body of the
          fallen Queen is carried with great solemnity to the principal
          square and publicly beheaded.<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A custom of the
          same sort prevails in various parts of Italy. Thus in the Abruzzi
          they hang a puppet of tow, representing Lent, to a cord, which
          stretches across the street from one window to another. Seven
          feathers are attached to the figure, and in its hand it grasps a
          distaff and spindle. Every Saturday in Lent one of the seven
          feathers is plucked out, and on Holy Saturday, while the bells are
          ringing, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg
          245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          string of chestnuts is burnt for the purpose of sending Lent and
          its meagre fare to the devil. In houses, too, it is usual to amuse
          children by cutting the figure of an old woman with seven legs out
          of pasteboard and sticking it beside the chimney. The old woman
          represents Lent, and her seven legs are the seven weeks of the
          fast; every Saturday one of the legs is amputated. At Mid-Lent the
          effigy is cut through the middle, and the part of which the feet
          have been already amputated is removed. Sometimes the figure is
          stuffed with sweets, dried fruits, and halfpence, for which the
          street urchins scramble when the puppet is bisected.<a id=

          the Sorrentine peninsula Lent is similarly represented by the
          effigy of a wrinkled old hag with a spindle and distaff, which is
          fastened to a balcony or a window. Attached to the figure is an
          orange with as many feathers stuck into it as there are weeks in
          Lent, and at the end of each week one of the feathers is plucked
          out. At Mid-Lent the puppet is sawn in two, an operation which is
          sometimes attended by a gush of blood from a bladder concealed in
          the interior of the figure. Any old women who shew themselves in
          the streets on that day are exposed to jibes and jests, and may be
          warned that they ought to remain at home.<a id="noteref_668" name=

          Castellammare, to the south of Naples, an English lady observed a
          rude puppet dangling from a string which spanned one of the narrow
          streets of the old town, being fastened at either end, high
          overhead, to the upper part of the many-storied houses. The puppet,
          about a foot long, was dressed all in black, rather like a nun, and
          from the skirts projected five or six feathers which bore a certain
          resemblance to legs. A peasant being asked what these things meant,
          replied with Italian vagueness, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is only
          Lent.”</span> Further enquiries, however, elicited the information
          that at the end of every week in Lent one of the feather legs was
          pulled off the puppet, and that the puppet was finally destroyed on
          the last day of Lent.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669" href=

          to roll down the slope. Next they cut a tall fir-tree, tricked it
          out with ribbons, and set it up in the plain. The men then climbed

          dressed in a veil furnished by the last bride and a shirt provided
          by the house in which the last death took place. Thus arrayed the
          figure is stuck on the end of a long pole and carried at full speed
          by the tallest and strongest girl, while the rest pelt the effigy
          with sticks and stones. Whoever hits it will be sure to live
          through the year. In this way Death is carried out of the village
          and thrown into the water or over the boundary of the next village.
          On their way home each one breaks a green branch and carries it
          gaily with him till he reaches the village, when he throws it away.
          Sometimes the young people of the next village, upon whose land the
          figure has been thrown, run after them and hurl it back, not
          wishing to have Death among them. Hence the two parties

          itself, and by a kind of resurrection it becomes the instrument of
          the general revival. Thus in some parts of Lusatia women alone are
          concerned in carrying out Death, and suffer no male to meddle with
          it. Attired in mourning, which they wear the whole day, they make a
          puppet of straw, clothe it in a white shirt, and give it a broom in
          one hand and a scythe in the other. Singing songs and pursued by
          urchins throwing stones, they carry the puppet to the village

          Ascension the Saxons of Braller, a village of Transylvania, not far
          from Hermannstadt, observe the ceremony of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Carrying out Death”</span> in the following manner.
          After morning service all the school-girls repair to the house of
          one of their number, and there dress up the Death. This is done by
          tying a threshed-out sheaf of corn into a rough semblance of a head
          and body, while the arms are simulated by a broomstick thrust
          through it horizontally. The figure is dressed in the holiday
          attire of a young peasant woman, with a red hood, silver brooches,
          and a profusion of ribbons at the arms and breast. The girls bustle
          at their work, for soon the bells will be ringing to vespers, and
          the Death must be ready in time to be placed at the open window,
          that all the people may see it on their way to church. When vespers
          are over, the longed-for moment has come for the first procession
          with the Death to begin; it is a privilege that belongs to the
          school-girls alone. Two of the older girls seize the figure by the
          arms and walk in front: all the rest follow two and two. Boys may
          take no part in the procession, but they troop after it gazing with
          open-mouthed admiration at the <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful
          Death.”</span> So the procession goes through all the streets of
          the village, the girls singing the old hymn that begins—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">to a tune that
          differs from the ordinary one. When the procession has wound its
          way through every street, the girls go to another house, and having
          shut the door against the eager prying crowd of boys who follow at
          their heels, they strip the Death and pass the naked truss of straw
          out of the window to the boys, who pounce on it, run out of the
          village with it without singing, and fling the dilapidated effigy
          into the neighbouring brook. This done, the second scene of the
          little drama begins. While the boys were carrying away the Death
          out of the village, the girls remained in the house, and one of
          them is now dressed in all the finery which had been worn by the
          effigy. Thus arrayed she is led in procession through all the
          streets to the singing of the same hymn as before. When the
          procession is over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
          249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          they all betake themselves to the house of the girl who played the
          leading part. Here a feast awaits them from which also the boys are
          excluded. It is a popular belief that the children may safely begin
          to eat gooseberries and other fruit after the day on which Death
          has thus been carried out; for Death, which up to that time lurked
          especially in gooseberries, is now destroyed. Further, they may now
          bathe with impunity out of doors.<a id="noteref_675" name=
          "noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a> Very
          similar is the ceremony which, down to recent years, was observed
          in some of the German villages of Moravia. Boys and girls met on
          the afternoon of the first Sunday after Easter, and together
          fashioned a puppet of straw to represent Death. Decked with
          bright-coloured ribbons and cloths, and fastened to the top of a
          long pole, the effigy was then borne with singing and clamour to
          the nearest height, where it was stript of its gay attire and
          thrown or rolled down the slope. One of the girls was next dressed
          in the gauds taken from the effigy of Death, and with her at its
          head the procession moved back to the village. In some villages the
          practice is to bury the effigy in the place that has the most evil
          reputation of all the country-side: others throw it into running
          water.<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Lusatian
          ceremony described above,<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677"

          tree which is brought home after the destruction of the figure of
          Death is plainly equivalent to the trees or branches which, in the
          preceding customs, were brought back as representatives of Summer
          or Life, after Death had been thrown away or destroyed. But the
          transference of the shirt worn by the effigy of Death to the tree
          clearly indicates that the tree is a kind of revivification, in a
          new form, of the destroyed effigy.<a id="noteref_678" name=
          "noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a> This
          comes out also in the Transylvanian and Moravian customs: the
          dressing of a girl in the clothes worn by the Death, and the
          leading her about the village to the same song which had been sung
          when the Death was being <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
          250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          carried about, shew that she is intended to be a kind of
          resuscitation of the being whose effigy has just been destroyed.
          These examples therefore suggest that the Death whose demolition is
          represented in these ceremonies cannot be regarded as the purely
          destructive agent which we understand by Death. If the tree which
          is brought back as an embodiment of the reviving vegetation of
          spring is clothed in the shirt worn by the Death which has just
          been destroyed, the object certainly cannot be to check and
          counteract the revival of vegetation: it can only be to foster and
          promote it. Therefore the being which has just been destroyed—the
          so-called Death—must be supposed to be endowed with a vivifying and
          quickening influence, which it can communicate to the vegetable and
          even the animal world. This ascription of a life-giving virtue to
          the figure of Death is put beyond a doubt by the custom, observed
          in some places, of taking pieces of the straw effigy of Death and
          placing them in the fields to make the crops grow, or in the manger
          to make the cattle thrive. Thus in Spachendorf, a village of
          Austrian Silesia, the figure of Death, made of straw, brushwood,
          and rags, is carried with wild songs to an open place outside the
          village and there burned, and while it is burning a general
          struggle takes place for the pieces, which are pulled out of the
          flames with bare hands. Each one who secures a fragment of the
          effigy ties it to a branch of the largest tree in his garden, or
          buries it in his field, in the belief that this causes the crops to
          grow better.<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href=
          "#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a> In
          the Troppau district of Austrian Silesia the straw figure which the
          boys make on the fourth Sunday in Lent is dressed by the girls in
          woman's clothes and hung with ribbons, necklace, and garlands.
          Attached to a long pole it is carried out of the village, followed
          by a troop of young people of both sexes, who alternately frolic,
          lament, and sing songs. Arrived at its destination—a field outside
          the village—the figure is stripped of its clothes and ornaments;
          then the crowd rushes at it and tears it to bits, scuffling for the
          fragments. Every one tries to get a wisp of the straw of which the
          effigy was made, because such a wisp, placed in the manger,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name=
          "Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is believed to make
          the cattle thrive.<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href=
          "#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> Or
          the straw is put in the hens' nest, it being supposed that this
          prevents the hens from carrying away their eggs, and makes them
          brood much better.<a id="noteref_681" name="noteref_681" href=
          "#note_681"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">681</span></span></a> The
          same attribution of a fertilising power to the figure of Death
          appears in the belief that if the bearers of the figure, after
          throwing it away, beat cattle with their sticks, this will render
          the beasts fat or prolific.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682"
          href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a>
          Perhaps the sticks had been previously used to beat the
          Death,<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href=
          "#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          so had acquired the fertilising power ascribed to the effigy. We
          have seen, too, that at Leipsic a straw effigy of Death was shewn
          to young wives to make them fruitful.<a id="noteref_684" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems hardly
          possible to separate from the May-trees the trees or branches which
          are brought into the village after the destruction of the Death.

          therefore the trees obviously represent the Summer; indeed in
          Silesia they are commonly called the Summer or the May,<a id=
          "noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="#note_686"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> and
          the doll which is sometimes attached to the Summer-tree is a
          duplicate representative of the Summer, just as the May is
          sometimes represented at the same time by a May-tree and a May
          Lady.<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a>
          Further, the Summer-trees are adorned like May-trees with ribbons
          and so on; like May-trees, when large, they are planted in the
          ground and climbed up; and like May-trees, when small, they are
          carried from door to door by boys or girls singing songs and
          collecting money.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> And
          as if to demonstrate the identity of the two sets of customs the
          bearers of the Summer-tree sometimes announce that they are
          bringing in the Summer and the May.<a id="noteref_689" name=
          "noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> The
          customs, therefore, of bringing in the May and bringing in the
          Summer are essentially the same; and the Summer-tree is merely
          another form of the May-tree, the only distinction <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (besides that of name) being in the
          time at which they are respectively brought in; for while the
          May-tree is usually fetched in on the first of May or at
          Whitsuntide, the Summer-tree is fetched in on the fourth Sunday in
          Lent. Therefore, if the May-tree is an embodiment of the
          tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation, the Summer-tree must likewise
          be an embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. But we
          have seen that the Summer-tree is in some cases a revivification of
          the effigy of Death. It follows, therefore, that in these cases the
          effigy called Death must be an embodiment of the tree-spirit or
          spirit of vegetation. This inference is confirmed, first, by the
          vivifying and fertilising influence which the fragments of the
          effigy of Death are believed to exercise both on vegetable and on
          animal life;<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href=
          "#note_690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> for
          this influence, as we saw in the first part of this work,<a id=
          "noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="#note_691"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> is
          supposed to be a special attribute of the tree-spirit. It is
          confirmed, secondly, by observing that the effigy of Death is
          sometimes decked with leaves or made of twigs, branches, hemp, or a
          threshed-out sheaf of corn;<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692"
          href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a> and
          that sometimes it is hung on a little tree and so carried about by
          girls collecting money,<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693" href=
          "#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> just
          as is done with the May-tree and the May Lady, and with the
          Summer-tree and the doll attached to it. In short we are driven to
          regard the expulsion of Death and the bringing in of Summer as, in
          some cases at least, merely another form of that death and revival
          of the spirit of vegetation in spring which we saw enacted in the
          killing and resurrection of the Wild Man.<a id="noteref_694" name=
          "noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> The
          burial and resurrection of the Carnival is probably another way of
          expressing the same idea. The interment of the representative of
          the Carnival under a dung-heap<a id="noteref_695" name=
          "noteref_695" href="#note_695"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a> is
          natural, if he is supposed to possess a quickening and fertilising
          influence like that ascribed to the effigy of Death. The
          Esthonians, indeed, who carry the straw figure out of the village
          in the usual way on Shrove Tuesday, do not call it the Carnival,
          but the Wood-spirit (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name=
          "Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> indicate the
          identity of the effigy with the wood-spirit by fixing it to the top
          of a tree in the wood, where it remains for a year, and is besought
          almost daily with prayers and offerings to protect the herds; for
          like a true wood-spirit the <span class=

          dealing. The very abstractness of the names bespeaks a modern
          origin; for the personification of times and seasons like the
          Carnival and Summer, or of an abstract notion like death, is hardly
          primitive. But the ceremonies themselves bear the stamp of a
          dateless antiquity; therefore we can hardly help supposing that in
          their origin the ideas which they embodied were of a more simple
          and concrete order. The notion of a tree, perhaps of a particular
          kind of tree (for some savages have no word for tree in general),
          or even of an individual tree, is sufficiently concrete to supply a
          basis from which by a gradual process of generalisation the wider
          idea of a spirit of vegetation might be reached. But this general
          idea of vegetation would readily be confounded with the season in
          which it manifests itself; hence the substitution of Spring,
          Summer, or May for the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation would be
          easy and natural. Again, the concrete notion of the dying tree or
          dying vegetation would by a similar process of generalisation glide
          into a notion of death in general; so that the practice of carrying
          out the dying or dead vegetation in spring, as a preliminary to its
          revival, would in time widen out into an attempt to banish Death in
          general from the village or district. The view that in these spring
          ceremonies Death meant originally the dying or dead vegetation of
          winter has the high support of W. Mannhardt; and he confirms it by
          the analogy of the name Death as applied to the spirit of the ripe
          corn. Commonly the spirit of the ripe <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> corn is conceived, not as dead, but as old,
          and hence it goes by the name of the Old Man or the Old Woman. But
          in some places the last sheaf cut at harvest, which is generally
          believed to be the seat of the corn spirit, is called "the Dead
          One": children are warned against entering the corn-fields because
          Death sits in the corn; and, in a game played by Saxon children in
          Transylvania at the maize harvest, Death is represented by a child
          completely covered with maize leaves.<a id="noteref_697" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes in the
          popular customs of the peasantry the contrast between the dormant
          powers of vegetation in winter and their awakening vitality in
          spring takes the form of a dramatic contest between actors who play
          the parts respectively of Winter and Summer. Thus in the towns of
          Sweden on May Day two troops of young men on horseback used to meet
          as if for mortal combat. One of them was led by a representative of
          Winter clad in furs, who threw snowballs and ice in order to
          prolong the cold weather. The other troop was commanded by a
          representative of Summer covered with fresh leaves and flowers. In
          the sham fight which followed the party of Summer came off
          victorious, and the ceremony ended with a feast.<a id="noteref_698"
          name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a>
          Again, in the region of the middle Rhine, a representative of
          Summer clad in ivy combats a representative of Winter clad in straw
          or moss and finally gains a victory over him. The vanquished foe is
          thrown to the ground and stripped of his casing of straw, which is
          torn to pieces and scattered about, while the youthful comrades of
          the two champions sing a song to commemorate the defeat of Winter
          by Summer. Afterwards they carry about a summer garland or branch
          and collect gifts of eggs and bacon from house to house. Sometimes
          the champion who acts the part of Summer is dressed in leaves and
          flowers and wears a chaplet of flowers on his head. In the
          Palatinate this mimic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
          255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          conflict takes place on the fourth Sunday in Lent.<a id=

          over Bavaria the same drama used to be acted on the same day, and
          it was still kept up in some places down to the middle of the
          nineteenth century or later. While Summer appeared clad all in
          green, decked with fluttering ribbons, and carrying a branch in
          blossom or a little tree hung with apples and pears, Winter was
          muffled up in cap and mantle of fur and bore in his hand a
          snow-shovel or a flail. Accompanied by their respective retinues
          dressed in corresponding attire, they went through all the streets
          of the village, halting before the houses and singing staves of old
          songs, for which they received presents of bread, eggs, and fruit.
          Finally, after a short struggle, Winter was beaten by Summer and
          ducked in the village well or driven out of the village with shouts
          and laughter into the forest.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700"

          some parts of Bavaria the boys who play the parts of Winter and
          Summer act their little drama in every house that they visit, and
          engage in a war of words before they come to blows, each of them
          vaunting the pleasures and benefits of the season he represents and
          disparaging those of the other. The dialogue is in verse. A few
          couplets may serve as specimens:—</p>

          Lower Austria, two men personating Summer and Winter used to go
          from house to house on Shrove Tuesday, and were everywhere welcomed
          by the children with great delight. The representative of Summer
          was clad in white and bore a sickle; his comrade, who played the
          part of Winter, had a fur-cap on his head, his arms and legs were
          swathed in straw, and he carried a flail. In every house they sang
          verses alternately.<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href=

          Drömling in Brunswick, down to the present time, the contest
          between Summer and Winter is acted every year at Whitsuntide by a
          troop of boys and a troop of girls. The boys rush singing,
          shouting, and ringing bells from house to house to drive Winter
          away; after them come the girls singing softly and led by a May
          Bride, all in bright dresses and decked with flowers and garlands
          to represent the genial advent of spring. Formerly the part of
          Winter was played by a straw-man which the boys carried with them;
          now it is acted by a real man in disguise.<a id="noteref_703" name=

          Wachtl and Brodek, a German village and a little German town of
          Moravia, encompassed by Slavonic people on every side, the great
          change that comes over the earth in spring is still annually
          mimicked. The long village of Wachtl, with its trim houses and
          farmyards, nestles in a valley surrounded by pretty pine-woods.
          Here, on a day in spring, about the time of the vernal equinox, an
          elderly man with a long flaxen beard may be seen going from door to
          door. He is muffled in furs, with warm gloves on his hands and a
          bearskin cap on his head, and he carries a threshing flail. This is
          the personification of Winter. With him goes a younger beardless
          man dressed in white, wearing a straw hat trimmed with gay ribbons
          on his head, and carrying a decorated May-tree in his hands. This
          is Summer. At every house they receive a friendly greeting and
          recite a long dialogue in verse, Winter punctuating his discourse
          with his flail, which he brings down with rude vigour on the backs
          of all within reach.<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href=

          Amongst the Slavonic population near Ungarisch Brod, in Moravia,
          the ceremony took a somewhat different form. <span class=

          procession round a May-tree. Then two others, one in white and one
          in green, stepped up to the tree and engaged in a dialogue.
          Finally, the girl in white was driven away, but returned afterwards
          clothed in green, and the festival ended with a dance.<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On May Day it
          used to be customary in almost all the large parishes of the Isle
          of Man to choose from among the daughters of the wealthiest farmers
          a young maiden to be Queen of May. She was dressed in the gayest
          attire and attended by about twenty others, who were called maids
          of honour. She had also a young man for her captain with a number
          of inferior officers under him. In opposition to her was the Queen
          of Winter, a man attired as a woman, with woollen hoods, fur
          tippets, and loaded with the warmest and heaviest clothes, one upon
          another. Her attendants were habited in like manner, and she too
          had a captain and troop for her defence. Thus representing
          respectively the beauty of spring and the deformity of winter they
          set forth from their different quarters, the one preceded by the
          dulcet music of flutes and violins, the other by the harsh clatter
          of cleavers and tongs. In this array they marched till they met on
          a common, where the trains of the two mimic sovereigns engaged in a
          mock battle. If the Queen of Winter's forces got the better of
          their adversaries and took her rival prisoner, the captive Queen of
          Summer was ransomed for as much as would pay the expenses of the
          festival. After this ceremony, Winter and her company retired and
          diverted themselves in a barn, while the partisans of Summer danced
          on the green, concluding the evening with a feast, at which the
          Queen and her maids sat at one table and the captain and his troop
          at another. In later times the person of the Queen of May was
          exempt from capture, but one of her slippers was substituted and,
          if captured, had to be ransomed to defray the expenses of the
          pageant. The procession of the Summer, which was subsequently
          composed of little girls and called the Maceboard, outlived that of
          its rival the Winter for some years; but both have now long been
          things of the past.<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          central Esquimaux of North America the contest between
          representatives of summer and winter, which in Europe has long
          degenerated into a mere dramatic performance, is still kept up as a
          magical ceremony of which the avowed intention is to influence the
          weather. In autumn, when storms announce the approach of the dismal
          Arctic winter, the Esquimaux divide themselves into two parties
          called respectively the ptarmigans and the ducks, the ptarmigans
          comprising all persons born in winter, and the ducks all persons
          born in summer. A long rope of sealskin is then stretched out, and
          each party laying hold of one end of it seeks by tugging with might
          and main to drag the other party over to its side. If the
          ptarmigans get the worst of it, then summer has won the game and
          fine weather may be expected to prevail through the winter.<a id=
          "noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> In
          this ceremony it is clearly assumed that persons born in summer
          have a natural affinity with warm weather, and therefore possess a
          power of mitigating the rigour of winter, whereas persons born in
          winter are, so to say, of a cold and frosty disposition and can
          thereby exert a refrigerating influence on the temperature of the
          air. In spite of this natural antipathy between the representatives
          of summer and winter, we may be allowed to conjecture that in the
          grand tug of war the ptarmigans do not pull at the rope with the
          same hearty goodwill as the ducks, and that thus the genial
          influence of summer commonly prevails over the harsh austerity of
          winter. The Indians of Canada seem also to have imagined that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name=
          "Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persons are endowed
          with distinct natural capacities according as they are born in
          summer or winter, and they turned the distinction to account in
          much the same fashion as the Esquimaux. When they wearied of the
          long frosts and the deep snow which kept them prisoners in their
          huts and prevented them from hunting, all of them who were born in
          summer rushed out of their houses armed with burning brands and
          torches which they hurled against the One who makes Winter; and
          this was supposed to produce the desired effect of mitigating the
          cold. But those Indians who were born in winter abstained from
          taking part in the ceremony, for they believed that if they meddled
          with it the cold would increase instead of diminishing.<a id=

          may surmise that in the corresponding European ceremonies, which
          have just been described, it was formerly deemed necessary that the
          actors, who played the parts of Winter and Summer, should have been
          born in the seasons which they personated.</p>

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Böggen</span></span>. They generally wear over
          their ordinary clothes a shirt decked with many-coloured ribbons,
          tall pointed paper caps on their heads, and masks before their
          faces. In this quaint costume they cart about through the streets
          effigies made of straw and other combustible materials which are
          supposed to represent Winter. At evening these effigies are burned
          in various parts of the city.<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709"

          ceremony was witnessed at Zurich on Monday, April 20th, 1903, by my
          friend Dr. J. Sutherland <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg
          261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Black, who has kindly furnished me with some notes on the subject.
          The effigy of Winter was a gigantic figure composed in great part,
          as it seemed, of cotton-wool. This was laid on a huge pyre, about
          thirty feet high, which had been erected on the Stadthausplatz
          close to the lake. In presence of a vast concourse of people fire
          was set to the pyre and all was soon in a blaze, while the town
          bells rang a joyous peal. As the figure gradually consumed in the
          flames, the mechanism enclosed in its interior produced a variety
          of grotesque effects, such as the gushing forth of bowels. At last
          nothing remained of the effigy but the iron backbone; the crowd
          slowly dispersed, and the fire brigade set to work to quench the
          smouldering embers.<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href=

          this ceremony the contest between Summer and Winter is rather
          implied than expressed, but the significance of the rite is
          unmistakable.</p>

          bonfire was kindled on the twenty-eighth of June, and on the next
          day the maidens chose one of their number to play the part of
          Kostroma. Her companions saluted her with deep obeisances, placed
          her on a board, and carried her to the bank of a stream. There they
          bathed her in the water, while the oldest girl made a basket of
          lime-tree bark and beat it like a drum. Then they returned to the

          dressed in woman's clothes and flowers. This was laid in a trough

          crowd divided into two sides, of which the one attacked and the
          other defended the figure. At last the assailants gained the day,
          stripped the figure of its dress and ornaments, tore it in pieces,
          trod the straw of which it was made under foot, and flung it into
          the stream; while the defenders of the figure hid their faces in
          their hands and pretended to bewail the death of Kostroma.<a id=

          twenty-ninth or thirtieth of June. The people chose an old man and
          gave him a small coffin containing a Priapus-like figure

          Yarilo. This he carried out of the town, followed by women chanting
          dirges and expressing by their gestures grief and despair. In the
          open fields a grave was dug, and into it the figure was lowered
          amid weeping and wailing, after which games and dances were begun,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“calling to mind the funeral games

          through the streets after sunset surrounded by drunken women, who
          kept repeating mournfully, <span class="tei tei-q">“He is dead! he
          is dead!”</span> The men lifted and shook the figure as if they
          were trying to recall the dead man to life. Then they said to the
          women, <span class="tei tei-q">“Women, weep not. I know what is
          sweeter than honey.”</span> But the women continued to lament and
          chant, as they do at funerals. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of what was
          he guilty? He was so good. He will arise no more. O how shall we

          also have been originally embodiments of the spirit of vegetation,

          to their revival. The revival as a sequel to the death is enacted
          in the first of the ceremonies described, the death and
          resurrection of Kostrubonko. The reason why in some of these
          Russian ceremonies the death of the spirit of vegetation is
          celebrated at midsummer may be that the decline of summer is dated
          from Midsummer Day, after which the days begin to shorten, and the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
          death of vegetation appears to have been represented in all, and
          its revival in some, of these spring and midsummer ceremonies,
          there are features in some of them which can hardly be explained on
          this hypothesis alone. The solemn funeral, the lamentations, and
          the mourning attire, which often characterise these rites, are
          indeed appropriate at the death of the beneficent spirit of
          vegetation. But what shall we say of the glee with which the effigy
          is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it is
          assailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it? What
          shall we say of the dread of the effigy evinced by the haste with
          which the bearers scamper home as soon as they have thrown it away,
          and by the belief that some one must soon die in any house into
          which it has looked? This dread might perhaps be explained by a
          belief that there is a certain infectiousness in the dead spirit of
          vegetation which renders its approach dangerous. But this
          explanation, besides being rather strained, does not cover the
          rejoicings which often attend the carrying out of Death. We must
          therefore recognise two distinct and seemingly opposite features in
          these ceremonies: on the one hand, sorrow for the death, and
          affection and respect for the dead; on the other hand, fear and
          hatred of the dead, and rejoicings at his death. How the former of
          these features is to be explained I have attempted to shew: how the
          latter came to be so closely associated with the former is a
          question which I shall try to answer in the sequel.</p>

          these European customs to go farther afield, it will be well to
          notice that occasionally the expulsion of Death or of a mythic
          being is conducted without any visible representative of the
          personage expelled. Thus at Königshain, near Görlitz in Silesia,
          all the villagers, young and old, used to go out with straw torches

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Kanagra
          district of India there is a custom observed by young girls in
          spring which closely resembles some of the European spring
          ceremonies just described. It is called the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ralî Ka
          melâ</span></span>, or fair of Ralî, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ralî</span></span> being a small painted
          earthen image of Siva or Pârvatî. The custom is in vogue all over
          the Kanagra district, and its celebration, which is entirely
          confined to young girls, lasts through most of Chet (March-April)
          up to the Sankrânt of Baisâkh (April). On a morning in March all
          the young girls of the village take small baskets of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dûb</span></span> grass and flowers to an
          appointed place, where they throw them in a heap. Round this heap
          they stand in a circle and sing. This goes on every day for ten
          days, till the heap of grass and flowers has reached a fair height.
          Then they cut in the jungle two branches, each with three prongs at
          one end, and place them, prongs downwards, over the heap of
          flowers, so as to make two tripods or pyramids. On the single
          uppermost points of these branches they get an image-maker to
          construct two clay images, one to represent Siva, and the other
          Pârvatî. The girls then divide themselves into two parties, one for
          Siva and one for Pârvatî, and marry the images in the usual way,
          leaving out no part of the ceremony. After the marriage they have a
          feast, the cost of which is defrayed by contributions solicited
          from their parents. Then at the next Sankrânt (Baisâkh) they all go
          together to the river-side, throw the images into a deep pool, and
          weep over the place, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg
          266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as though they were performing funeral obsequies. The boys of the
          neighbourhood often tease them by diving after the images, bringing
          them up, and waving them about while the girls are crying over
          them. The object of the fair is said to be to secure a good
          husband.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That in this
          Indian ceremony the deities Siva and Pârvatî are conceived as
          spirits of vegetation seems to be proved by the placing of their
          images on branches over a heap of grass and flowers. Here, as often
          in European folk-custom, the divinities of vegetation are
          represented in duplicate, by plants and by puppets. The marriage of
          these Indian deities in spring corresponds to the European
          ceremonies in which the marriage of the vernal spirits of
          vegetation is represented by the King and Queen of May, the May
          Bride, Bridegroom of the May, and so forth.<a id="noteref_720"

          throwing of the images into the water, and the mourning for them,
          are the equivalents of the European customs of throwing the dead
          spirit of vegetation under the name of Death, Yarilo, Kostroma, and
          the rest, into the water and lamenting over it. Again, in India, as
          often in Europe, the rite is performed exclusively by females. The
          notion that the ceremony helps to procure husbands for the girls
          can be explained by the quickening and fertilising influence which
          the spirit of vegetation is believed to exert upon the life of man
          as well as of plants.<a id="noteref_721" name="noteref_721" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
          explanation which we have been led to adopt of these and many
          similar ceremonies is that they are, or were in their origin,
          magical rites intended to ensure the revival of nature in spring.
          The means by which they were supposed to effect this end were
          imitation and sympathy. Led astray by his ignorance of the true
          causes of things, primitive man believed that in order to produce
          the great phenomena of nature on which his life depended he had
          only to imitate them, and that immediately by a secret <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sympathy or mystic influence the little
          drama which he acted in forest glade or mountain dell, on desert
          plain or wind-swept shore, would be taken up and repeated by
          mightier actors on a vaster stage. He fancied that by masquerading
          in leaves and flowers he helped the bare earth to clothe herself
          with verdure, and that by playing the death and burial of winter he
          drove that gloomy season away, and made smooth the path for the
          footsteps of returning spring. If we find it hard to throw
          ourselves even in fancy into a mental condition in which such
          things seem possible, we can more easily picture to ourselves the
          anxiety which the savage, when he first began to lift his thoughts
          above the satisfaction of his merely animal wants, and to meditate
          on the causes of things, may have felt as to the continued
          operation of what we now call the laws of nature. To us, familiar
          as we are with the conception of the uniformity and regularity with
          which the great cosmic phenomena succeed each other, there seems
          little ground for apprehension that the causes which produce these
          effects will cease to operate, at least within the near future. But
          this confidence in the stability of nature is bred only by the
          experience which comes of wide observation and long tradition; and
          the savage, with his narrow sphere of observation and his
          short-lived tradition, lacks the very elements of that experience
          which alone could set his mind at rest in face of the ever-changing
          and often menacing aspects of nature. No wonder, therefore, that he
          is thrown into a panic by an eclipse, and thinks that the sun or
          the moon would surely perish, if he did not raise a clamour and
          shoot his puny shafts into the air to defend the luminaries from
          the monster who threatens to devour them. No wonder he is terrified
          when in the darkness of night a streak of sky is suddenly illumined
          by the flash of a meteor, or the whole expanse of the celestial
          arch glows with the fitful light of the Northern Streamers.<a id=

          phenomena which recur at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg
          268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fixed and uniform intervals may be viewed by him with apprehension,
          before he has come to recognise the orderliness of their
          recurrence. The speed or slowness of his recognition of such
          periodic or cyclic changes in nature will depend largely on the
          length of the particular cycle. The cycle, for example, of day and
          night is everywhere, except in the polar regions, so short and
          hence so frequent that men probably soon ceased to discompose
          themselves seriously as to the chance of its failing to recur,
          though the ancient Egyptians, as we have seen, daily wrought
          enchantments to bring back to the east in the morning the fiery orb
          which had sunk at evening in the crimson west. But it was far
          otherwise with the annual cycle of the seasons. To any man a year
          is a considerable period, seeing that the number of our years is
          but few at the best. To the primitive savage, with his short memory
          and imperfect means of marking the flight of time, a year may well
          have been so long that he failed to recognise it as a cycle at all,
          and watched the changing aspects of earth and heaven with a
          perpetual wonder, alternately delighted and alarmed, elated and
          cast down, according as the vicissitudes of light and heat, of
          plant and animal life, ministered to his comfort or threatened his
          existence. In autumn when the withered leaves were whirled about
          the forest by the nipping blast, and he looked up at the bare
          boughs, could he feel sure that they would ever be green again? As
          day by day the sun sank lower and lower in the sky, could he be
          certain that the luminary would ever retrace his heavenly road?
          Even the waning moon, whose pale sickle rose thinner and thinner
          every night over the rim of the eastern horizon, may have excited
          in his mind a fear lest, when it had wholly vanished, there should
          be moons no more.</p>

          the world he lived in, and to take thought for a more distant
          future than the morrow. It was natural, therefore, that with such
          thoughts and fears he should have done all that in him lay to bring
          back the faded blossom to the bough, to swing the low sun of winter
          up to his old place in the summer sky, and to restore its orbed

          endeavours if we please, but it was only by making a long series of
          experiments, of which some were almost inevitably doomed to
          failure, that man learned from experience the futility of some of
          his attempted methods and the fruitfulness of others. After all,
          magical ceremonies are nothing but experiments which have failed

          operator is unaware of their failure. With the advance of knowledge
          these ceremonies either cease to be performed altogether or are
          kept up from force of habit long after the intention with which
          they were instituted has been forgotten. Thus fallen from their
          high estate, no longer regarded as solemn rites on the punctual
          performance of which the welfare and even the life of the community
          depend, they sink gradually to the level of simple pageants,
          mummeries, and pastimes, till in the final stage of degeneration
          they are wholly abandoned by older people, and, from having once
          been the most serious occupation of the sage, become at last the
          idle sport of children. It is in this final stage of decay that
          most of the old magical rites of our European forefathers linger on
          at the present day, and even from this their last retreat they are
          fast being swept away by the rising tide of those multitudinous
          forces, moral, intellectual, and social, which are bearing mankind
          onward to a new and unknown goal. We may feel some natural regret
          at the disappearance of quaint customs and picturesque ceremonies,
          which have preserved to an age often deemed dull and prosaic
          something of the flavour and freshness of the olden time, some
          breath of the springtime of the world; yet our regret will be
          lessened when we remember that these pretty pageants, these now
          innocent diversions, had their origin in ignorance and
          superstition; that if they are a record of human endeavour, they
          are also a monument of fruitless ingenuity, of wasted labour, and
          of blighted hopes; and that for all their gay trappings—their
          flowers, their ribbons, and their music—they partake far more of
          tragedy than of farce.</p>

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> W. Mannhardt, I have attempted to give
          of these ceremonies has been not a little confirmed by the
          discovery, made since this book was first written, that the natives
          of Central Australia regularly practise magical ceremonies for the
          purpose of awakening the dormant energies of nature at the approach
          of what may be called the Australian spring. Nowhere apparently are
          the alternations of the seasons more sudden and the contrasts
          between them more striking than in the deserts of Central
          Australia, where at the end of a long period of drought the sandy
          and stony wilderness, over which the silence and desolation of
          death appear to brood, is suddenly, after a few days of torrential
          rain, transformed into a landscape smiling with verdure and peopled
          with teeming multitudes of insects and lizards, of frogs and birds.
          The marvellous change which passes over the face of nature at such
          times has been compared even by European observers to the effect of
          magic;<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href=

          wonder, then, that the savage should regard it as such in very
          deed. Now it is just when there is promise of the approach of a
          good season that the natives of Central Australia are wont
          especially to perform those magical ceremonies of which the avowed
          intention is to multiply the plants and animals they use as
          food.<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> These
          ceremonies, therefore, present a close analogy to the spring
          customs of our European peasantry not only in the time of their
          celebration, but also in their aim; for we can hardly doubt that in
          instituting rites designed to assist the revival of plant life in
          spring our primitive forefathers were moved, not by any sentimental
          wish to smell at early violets, or pluck the rathe primrose, or
          watch yellow daffodils dancing in the breeze, but by the very
          practical consideration, certainly not formulated in abstract
          terms, that the life of man is inextricably bound up with that of
          plants, and that if they were to perish he could not survive. And
          as the faith of the Australian savage in the efficacy of his magic
          rites is confirmed by observing that their performance is
          invariably followed, sooner or later, by that increase of vegetable
          and animal life which it is their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> object to produce, so, we may suppose, it was
          with European savages in the olden time. The sight of the fresh
          green in brake and thicket, of vernal flowers blowing on mossy
          banks, of swallows arriving from the south, and of the sun mounting
          daily higher in the sky, would be welcomed by them as so many
          visible signs that their enchantments were indeed taking effect,
          and would inspire them with a cheerful confidence that all was well
          with a world which they could thus mould to suit their wishes. Only
          in autumn days, as summer slowly faded, would their confidence
          again be dashed by doubts and misgivings at symptoms of decay,
          which told how vain were all their efforts to stave off for ever
          the approach of winter and of death.</p>

          enquiries I hear from a Mr. Eames, a lawyer who practised for some
          years at Shanghai and has considerable knowledge of Chinese
          matters, that for a small sum a substitute can be found for
          execution. This is recognised by the Chinese authorities, with
          certain exceptions, as for instance parricide. It is even asserted
          that the local Taotai gains pecuniarily by this arrangement, as he
          is as a rule not above obtaining a substitute for the condemned man

          was a surprise to me to hear that the accuracy of the statement was

          China that the practice exists. The difficulty, I conceive, will be
          to obtain evidence enabling one to quote concrete cases. My own
          impression is that the practice is quite justifiable according to
          Chinese ethics when life is given up from motives of filial piety,
          that is to say in order to relieve the wants of indigent parents,
          or to defray the costs of ancestral rights [</span><span class=

          "font-size: 90%">]. Your general thesis that life is less valued
          and more readily sacrificed by some races than by modern Europeans
          seems to be beyond dispute. Surely the Japanese practice of</span>

          as it is vulgarly called, is a case in point. Life is risked, as in
          duelling, by Europeans, for the mere point of honour, but it is
          never deliberately laid down in satisfaction of the exigencies of
          the social code. I will send you whatever information I can obtain
          when it reaches me, but that will not of course be for some

          Chinese (Spencerian publications), but have not been able to do so
          in the absence of an index to that voluminous work. More than one
          of the authors whom he quotes have certainly referred to cases of
          substitution for death-sentence prisoners. Parker, for instance
          (</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style=

          were to be had in Canton at the reasonable price of fifty taels
          (say £10). Dr. Matignon (in</span> <span class=

          <span style="font-size: 90%">page 113) says that filial piety is a
          frequent motive. The negative opinion of Professors Giles and de
          Groot is entitled to consideration, but cannot be regarded as any
          more conclusive than the views expressed by Professor Giles on the
          question of infanticide which are outweighed by a mass of direct

        question involves a grave miscarriage of justice, the discovery of
        which might entail serious consequences on the magistrate who
        connived at it, we need not wonder that it is generally hushed up,
        and that no instances of it should come to the ears of many Europeans
        resident in China. My friend Professor H. A. Giles of Cambridge in
        conversation expressed himself quite incredulous on the subject, and
        Professor J. J. M. de Groot of Leyden wrote to me (January 31, 1902)
        to the same effect. The Rev. Dr. W. T. A. Barber, Headmaster of the
        Leys School, Cambridge, and formerly a missionary in China, wrote to
        me (January 30, 1902): <span class="tei tei-q">“As to the possibility
        that a man condemned to death may secure a substitute on payment of a
        moderate sum of money, we used to hear that this was the case; but I
        have no proof that would justify you in using the fact.”</span>
        Another experienced missionary, the Rev. W. A. Cornaby, wrote to Dr.
        Barber: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have heard of no such custom in
        capital crimes. The man in whose house a fire starts may, and often
        does, pay another to receive the blows and three <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">‘foreign riots’</span> were the case, and a
        previously condemned criminal handy, I should hardly think it
        possible. Every precaution is taken that no one is beheaded but the

        that if every execution costs the local mandarin so dear, he must be

        whenever he can do so without being detected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
        swinging has been practised as a religious or rather magical rite in
        various parts of the world, but it does not seem possible to explain
        all the instances of it in the same way. People appear to have
        resorted to the practice from different motives and with different
        ideas of the benefit to be derived from it. In the text we have seen
        that the Letts, and perhaps the Siamese, swing to make the crops grow
        tall.<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href=

        swing one after the other on these occasions.<a id="noteref_729"

        great Dassera festival of Nepaul, which immediately precedes the
        cutting of the rice, swings and kites come into fashion among the
        young people of both sexes. The swings are sometimes hung from boughs
        of trees, but generally from a cross-beam supported on a framework of
        tall bamboos.<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we see that
        people swing in order to procure a plentiful supply of fish and game
        as well as good crops. In such cases the notion seems to be that the
        ceremony promotes fertility, whether in the vegetable or the animal
        kingdom; though why it should be supposed to do so, I confess myself
        unable to explain. There seem to be some reasons for thinking that
        the Indian rite of swinging on hooks run through the flesh of the
        performer is also resorted to, at least in some cases, from a belief
        in its fertilising virtue. Thus Hamilton tells us that at Karwar, on
        the west coast of India, a feast is held at the end of May or
        beginning of June in honour of the infernal gods, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“with a divination or conjuration to know the fate of the
        ensuing crop of corn.”</span> Men were hung from a pole by means of
        tenter-hooks inserted in the flesh of their backs; and the pole with
        the men dangling from it was then dragged for more than a mile over
        ploughed ground from one sacred grove to another, preceded by a young
        girl who carried a pot of fire on her head. When the second grove was
        reached, the men were let down and taken off the hooks, and the girl
        fell into the usual prophetic frenzy, after which she unfolded to the
        priests the revelation with which she had just been favoured by the
        terrestrial gods. In each of the groves a shapeless black stone,
        daubed with red lead to stand for a mouth, eyes, and ears, appears to
        have represented the indwelling divinity.<a id="noteref_735" name=
        "noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a>
        Sometimes this custom of swinging on hooks, which is known among the
        Hindoos as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Churuk Puja</span></span>, seems to be intended
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279"
        id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to propitiate demons. Some
        Santals asked Mr. V. Ball to be allowed to perform it because their
        women and children were dying of sickness, and their cattle were
        being killed by wild beasts; they believed that these misfortunes
        befell them because the evil spirits had not been appeased.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> These
        same Santals celebrate a swinging festival of a less barbarous sort
        about the month of February. Eight men sit in chairs and rotate round
        posts in a sort of revolving swing, like the merry-go-rounds which
        are so dear to children at English fairs.<a id="noteref_737" name=

        the rainy season in Behar young women swing in their houses, while
        they sing songs appropriate to the season. The period during which
        they indulge in this pastime, if a mere pastime it be, is strictly
        limited; it begins with a festival which usually falls on the
        twenty-fifth of the month Jeyt and ends with another festival which
        commonly takes place on the twenty-fifth of the month Asin. No one
        would think of swinging at any other time of the year.<a id=
        "noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> It is
        possible that this last custom may be nothing more than a pastime
        meant to while away some of the tedious hours of the inclement
        season; but its limitation to a certain clearly-defined portion of
        the year seems rather to point to a religious or magical origin.
        Possibly the intention may once have been to drive away the rain. We
        shall see immediately that swinging is sometimes resorted to for the
        purpose of expelling the powers of evil. About the middle of March
        the Hindoos observe a swinging festival of a different sort in honour
        of the god Krishna, whose image is placed in the seat or cradle of a
        swing and then, just when the dawn is breaking, rocked gently to and
        fro several times. The same ceremony is repeated at noon and at
        sunset.<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href=
        "#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> In the
        Rigveda the sun is called, by a natural metaphor, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the golden swing in the sky,”</span> and the expression
        helps us to understand a ceremony of Vedic India. A priest sat in a
        swing and touched with the span of his right hand at once the seat of
        the swing and the ground. In doing so he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
        280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        great lord has united himself with the great lady, the god has united
        himself with the goddess.”</span> Perhaps he meant to indicate in a
        graphic way that the sun had reached that lowest point of its course
        where it was nearest to the earth.<a id="noteref_741" name=
        "noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a> In this
        connexion it is of interest to note that in the Esthonian celebration
        of St. John's Day or the summer solstice swings play, along with
        bonfires, the most prominent part. Girls sit and swing the whole
        night through, singing old songs to explain why they do so. For
        legend tells of an Esthonian prince who wooed and won an Islandic
        princess. But a wicked enchanter spirited away the lover to a desert
        island, where he languished in captivity, till his lady-love
        contrived to break the magic spell that bound him. Together they
        sailed home to Esthonia, which they reached on St. John's Day, and
        burnt their ship, resolved to stray no longer in far foreign lands.
        The swings in which the Esthonian maidens still rock themselves on
        St. John's Day are said to recall the ship in which the lovers tossed
        upon the stormy sea, and the bonfires commemorate the burning of it.
        When the fires have died out, the swings are laid aside and never
        used again either in the village or at the solitary alehouse until
        spring comes round once more.<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742"
        href="#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a> Here it
        is natural to connect both swings and bonfires with the apparent
        course of the sun, who reaches the highest and turning point of his
        orbit on St. John's Day. Bonfires and swings perhaps were originally
        charms intended to kindle and speed afresh on its heavenly road
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the golden swing in the sky.”</span> Among
        the Letts of South Livonia and Curland the summer solstice is the
        occasion of a great festival of flowers, at which the people sing
        songs with the constant refrain of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lihgo,
        lihgo</span></span>. It has been proposed to derive the word
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        in his passage through the air the physician is likely to collide
        with the disease and the evil spirits, both of which are sure to be
        loitering about in the neighbourhood of the patient, and the rude
        shock thus given to the malady and the demons may reasonably be
        expected to push or hustle them away. At Tengaroeng, in Eastern
        Borneo, a traveller witnessed a ceremony for the expulsion of an evil
        spirit in which swinging played a part. After four men in blue shirts
        bespangled with stars, and wearing coronets of red cloth decorated
        with beads and bells, had sought diligently for the devil, grabbling
        about on the floor and grunting withal, three hideous hags dressed in
        faded red petticoats were brought in with great pomp, carried on the
        shoulders of Malays, and took their seats, amid solemn silence, on
        the cradle of a swing, the ends of which were carved to represent the
        head and tail of a crocodile. Not a sound escaped from the crowd of
        spectators during this awe-inspiring ceremony; they regarded the
        business as most serious. The venerable dames then rocked to and fro
        on the swing, fanning themselves languidly with Chinese paper fans.
        At a later stage of the performance they and three girls discharged
        burning arrows at a sort of altar of banana leaves, maize, and grass.
        This completed the discomfiture of the devil.<a id="noteref_746"

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Athenians in
        antiquity celebrated an annual festival of swinging. Boards were hung
        from trees by ropes, and people sitting on them swung to and fro,
        while they sang songs of a loose or voluptuous character. The
        swinging went on both in public and private. Various explanations
        were given of the custom; the most generally received was as follows.
        When Bacchus came among men to make known to them the pleasures of
        wine, he lodged with a certain Icarus or Icarius, to whom he revealed
        the precious secret and bade him go forth and carry the glad tidings
        to all the world. So Icarus loaded a waggon with wine-skins, and set
        out on his travels, the dog Maera running beside him. He came to
        Attica, and there fell in with shepherds tending their sheep, to whom
        he gave of the wine. They drank greedily, but when some of them fell
        down dead drunk, their companions thought the stranger had poisoned
        them with intent to steal the sheep; so they knocked him on the head.
        The faithful dog ran home and guided his master's daughter Erigone to
        the body. At sight of it she was smitten with <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> despair and hanged herself on a tree
        beside her dead father, but not until she had prayed that, unless the
        Athenians should avenge her sire's murder, their daughters might die
        the same death as she. Her curse was fulfilled, for soon many
        Athenian damsels hanged themselves for no obvious reason. An oracle
        informed the Athenians of the true cause of this epidemic of suicide;
        so they sought out the bodies of the unhappy pair and instituted the
        swinging festival to appease Erigone; and at the vintage they offered
        the first of the grapes to her and her father.<a id="noteref_747"

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the swinging
        festival at Athens was regarded by the ancients as an expiation for a
        suicide or suicides by hanging. This opinion is strongly confirmed by
        a statement of Varro, that it was unlawful to perform funeral rites
        in honour of persons who had died by hanging, but that in their case
        such rites were replaced by a custom of swinging images, as if in
        imitation of the death they had died.<a id="noteref_748" name=
        "noteref_748" href="#note_748"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a> Servius
        says that the Athenians, failing to find the bodies of Icarius and
        Erigone on earth, made a pretence of seeking them in the air by
        swinging on ropes hung from trees; and he seems to have regarded the
        custom of swinging as a purification by means of air.<a id=
        "noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> This
        explanation probably comes very near the truth; indeed if we
        substitute <span class="tei tei-q">“souls”</span> for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“bodies”</span> in the wording of it we may almost accept
        it as exact. It might be thought that the souls of persons who had
        died by hanging were, more than the souls of the other dead, hovering
        in the air, since their bodies were suspended in air at the moment of
        death. Hence it would be considered needful to purge the air of these
        vagrant spirits, and this might be done by swinging persons or things
        to and fro, in order that by their impact they might disperse and
        drive away the baleful ghosts. Thus the custom would be exactly
        analogous, on the one hand, to the practice of the Malay
        medicine-man, who swings to and fro in front of the patient's house
        in order to chase away the disease, or to frighten away evil spirits,
        or to catch the stray soul of the sick man, and, on the other hand,
        to the practice of the Central Australian <span class="tei tei-pb"

        swinging seems to have formed part of the great Latin festival

        "font-style: italic">Feriae Latinae</span></span>), and its origin
        was traced to a search in the air for the body or even the soul of

        Mezentius, King of Caere.<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet on the other
        hand there are circumstances which point to an intimate association,
        both at Athens and Rome, of these swinging festivals with an
        intention of promoting the growth of cultivated plants. Such
        circumstances are the legendary connexion of the Athenian festival
        with Bacchus, the custom of offering the first-fruits of the vintage
        to Erigone and Icarius,<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href=
        "#note_752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a> and at

        we can reconcile the two apparently discrepant effects attributed to
        swinging as a means of expiation on the one side and of fertilisation
        on the other, by supposing that in both cases the intention is to
        clear the air of dangerous influences, whether these are ghosts of
        the unburied dead or spiritual powers inimical to the growth of
        plants. Independent of both appears to be the notion that the higher
        you swing the higher will grow the crops.<a id="noteref_755" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In modern Greece
        and Italy the custom of swinging as a festal rite, whatever its
        origin may be, is still observed in some places. At the small village
        of Koukoura in Elis an English traveller observed peasants swinging
        from a tree in honour of St. George, whose festival it was.<a id=

        Tuesday after Easter the maidens of Seriphos play their favourite
        game of the swing. They hang a rope from one wall to another of the
        steep, narrow, filthy street, and putting some clothes on it swing
        one after the other, singing as they swing. Young men who try to pass
        are called upon to pay toll in the shape of a penny, a song, and a
        swing. The words which the youth sings are generally these:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The gold is swung, the silver is swung, and
        swung too is my love with the golden hair”</span>; to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284"

        Greek island of Karpathos the villagers assemble at a given place on
        each of the four Sundays before Easter, a swing is erected, and the
        women swing one after the other, singing death wails such as they
        chant round the mimic tombs in church on the night of Good
        Friday.<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href=

        Christmas Day peasant girls in some villages of Calabria fasten ropes
        to iron rings in the ceiling and swing on them, while they sing
        certain songs prescribed by custom for the occasion. The practice is
        regarded not merely as an amusement but also as an act of
        devotion.<a id="noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a custom in Cadiz, when Christmas
        comes, to fasten swings in the courtyards of houses, and even in the
        houses themselves when there is no room for them outside. In the
        evenings lads and lasses assemble round the swings and pass the time
        happily in swinging amid joyous songs and cries. The swings are taken

        observance of the custom at Christmas, that is, at the winter
        solstice, suggests that in Calabria and Spain, as in Esthonia, the
        pastime may originally have been a magical rite designed to assist
        the sun in climbing the steep ascent to the top of the summer sky. If
        this were so, we might surmise that the gold and the golden hair
        mentioned by youths and maidens of Seriphos as they swing refer to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the golden swing in the sky,”</span> in
        other words to the sun whose golden lamp swings daily across the blue
        vault of heaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However that may
        be, it would seem that festivals of swinging are especially held in
        spring. This is true, for example, of North Africa, where such
        festivals are common. At some places in that part of the world the
        date of the swinging is the time of the apricots; at others it is
        said to be the spring equinox. In some places the festival lasts
        three days, and fathers who have had children born to them within the
        year bring them and swing them in the swings.<a id="noteref_761"

        called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        worshipped, and swings are put up in the yards of most houses for the
        amusement of the people. The women on this day may go about the
        streets; during the rest of the year they may go out only after dark.
        Dressed in their prettiest clothes, they visit the various houses and
        amuse themselves swinging. The swing is said to convey the idea of
        keeping cool in the approaching summer. It is one of <span class=

        the reason here assigned for swinging may explain other instances of
        the custom; on the principles of homoeopathic magic the swinging may
        be regarded as a means of ensuring a succession of cool refreshing
        breezes during the oppressive heat of the ensuing summer.</p>

          was an article of the Egyptian creed that every god must die after
          he had begotten a son in his own likeness (A. Wiedemann,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herodots
          zweites Buch</span></span>, p. 204). Hence the Egyptian deities
          were commonly arranged in trinities of a simple and natural type,
          each comprising a father, a mother, and a son. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Speaking generally, two members of such a triad were
          gods, one old and one young, and the third was a goddess, who was,
          naturally, the wife, or female counterpart, of the older god. The
          younger god was the son of the older god and goddess, and he was
          supposed to possess all the attributes and powers which belonged to
          his father.... The feminine counterpart or wife of the chief god
          was usually a local goddess of little or no importance; on the
          other hand, her son by the chief god was nearly as important as his
          father, because it was assumed that he would succeed to his rank
          and throne when the elder god had passed away. The conception of
          the triad or trinity is, in Egypt, probably as old as the belief in
          gods, and it seems to be based on the anthropomorphic views which
          were current in the earliest times about them”</span> (E. A. Wallis
          Budge, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The Gods of the Egyptians</span></span>,
          London, 1904, i. 113 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>). If the Christian doctrine
          of the Trinity took shape under Egyptian influence, the function
          originally assigned to the Holy Spirit may have been that of the
          divine mother. In the apocryphal <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel to the
          Hebrews</span></span>, as Mr. F. C. Conybeare was kind enough to
          point out to me, Christ spoke of the Holy Ghost as his mother. The
          passage is quoted by Origen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Comment. in Joan. II.</span></span> vol. iv.
          col. 132, ed. Migne), and runs as follows: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My mother the Holy Spirit took me a moment ago by one
          of my hairs and carried me away to the great Mount Tabor.”</span>
          Compare Origen, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">In Jeremiam Hom.</span></span> XV. 4, vol.
          iii. col. 433, ed. Migne. In the reign of Trajan a certain
          Alcibiades, from Apamea in Syria, appeared at Rome with a volume in
          which the Holy Ghost was described as a stalwart female about
          ninety-six miles high and broad in proportion. See Hippolytus,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Refut.
          omnium haeresium</span></span>, ix. 13, p. 462, ed. Duncker and
          Schneidewin. The Ophites represented the Holy Spirit as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the first woman,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“mother of all living,”</span> who was beloved by
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the first man”</span> and likewise by

          by one or both of them <span class="tei tei-q">“the light, which
          they call Christ.”</span> See H. Usener, <span class=

          (Edinburgh, 1811). Mr. Conybeare tells me that Philo Judaeus, who
          lived in the first half of the first century of our era, constantly
          defines God as a Trinity in Unity, or a Unity in Trinity, and that
          the speculations of this Alexandrian Jew deeply influenced the
          course of Christian thought on the mystical nature of the deity.
          Thus it seems not impossible that the ancient Egyptian doctrine of
          the divine Trinity may have been distilled through Philo into
          Christianity. On the other hand it has been suggested that the
          Christian Trinity is of Babylonian origin. See H. Zimmern, in E.
          Schrader's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This is in substance the explanation
          briefly suggested by F. Liebrecht, and developed more fully and
          with certain variations of detail by S. Reinach. See F. Liebrecht,

          or Adonis in Syria and Greece see my <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adonis, Attis,
          Osiris</span></span>, Second Edition (London, 1907). In Plutarch's
          narrative confusion seems to have arisen through the native name
          (Tammuz) of the deity, which either accidentally coincided with
          that of the pilot (as S. Reinach thinks) or was erroneously
          transferred to him by a narrator (as F. Liebrecht supposed). An
          entirely different explanation of the story has been proposed by
          Dr. W. H. Roscher. He holds that the god whose death was lamented
          was the great ram-god of Mendes in Egypt, whom Greek writers
          constantly mistook for a goat-god and identified with Pan. A living
          ram was always revered as an incarnation of the god, and when it
          died there was a great mourning throughout all the land of Mendes.
          Some stone coffins of the sacred animal have been found in the
          ruins of the city. See Herodotus, ii. 46, with A. Wiedemann's
          commentary; W. H. Roscher, <span class="tei tei-q">“Die Legende vom

          doubtless occurred once; at the present day and perhaps for the
          whole of the historic period it has been superseded by the

          description as much overdrawn; in an average year, he tells me, the
          cattle do not die of famine and the natives are not starving.
          According to his information the drinking of the blood of their
          cattle is a luxury in which the Dinka indulge themselves at any

          towards the end of the seventeenth century, but during the
          eighteenth and nineteenth centuries cases of collective suicide
          from religious motives occurred from time to time, people burning

          literally <span class="tei tei-q">“a period of three years”</span>;
          a cycle of eight years is <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ennaeteris</span></span>, literally
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a period of nine years”</span>; and so
          forth. See Censorinus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De die natali</span></span>, 18. The Latin use
          of the ordinal numbers is similar, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
          our <span class="tei tei-q">“every second year”</span> would be

          However, the Greeks and Romans were not always consistent in this
          matter, for they occasionally reckoned in our fashion. The
          resulting ambiguity is not only puzzling to moderns; it sometimes
          confused the ancients themselves. For example, it led to a
          derangement of the newly instituted Julian calendar, which escaped
          detection for more than thirty years. See Macrobius, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturn.</span></span>
          i. 14. 13 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>; Solinus, i. 45-47. On the
          ancient modes of counting in such cases see A. Schmidt,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Handbuch
          der griechischen Chronologie</span></span> (Jena, 1888), pp. 95
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span> According to Schmidt, the
          practice of adding both terms to the sum of the intervening units
          was not extended by the Greeks to numbers above nine.</dd>

          suggested that the central scene on the eastern frieze of the
          Parthenon represents the king and queen of Athens about to take
          their places among the enthroned deities. See his article

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Classical

          frieze appear to have been copied from the Panathenaiac festival,
          it would seem, on Mr. Cook's hypothesis, that the sacred marriage
          of the King and Queen was celebrated on that occasion in presence
          of actors who played the parts of gods and goddesses. In this
          connexion it may not be amiss to remember that in the eastern gable
          of the Parthenon the pursuit of the moon by the sun was mythically
          represented by the horses of the sun emerging from the sea on the
          one side, and the horses of the moon plunging into it on the
          other.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Many years after the theory in the
          text was printed (for the present volume has been long in the
          press) I accidentally learned that my friend Mr. F. M. Cornford,
          Fellow and Lecturer of Trinity College, Cambridge, had quite
          independently arrived at a similar conclusion with regard to the
          mythical and dramatic parts played by the Olympic victors, male and
          female, as representatives of the Sun and Moon, and I had the
          pleasure of hearing him expound the theory in a brilliant lecture
          delivered before the Classical Society of Cambridge, 28th February
          1911. The coincidence of two independent enquirers in conclusions,
          which can hardly be called obvious, seems to furnish a certain
          confirmation of their truth. In Mr. Cornford's case the theory in
          question forms part of a more elaborate and comprehensive
          hypothesis as to the origin of the Olympic games, concerning which
          I must for the present suspend my judgment.</dd>

          (vol. i. p. 76, ed. L. Dindorf). Dio Chrysostom does not mention
          his authority, but it was probably either Berosus or Ctesias. The
          execution of the mock king is not noticed in the passage of Berosus
          cited by Athenaeus, probably because the mention of it was not
          germane to Athenaeus's purpose, which was simply to give a list of
          festivals at which masters waited on their servants. A passage of
          Macrobius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          sometimes been interpreted as referring to this Babylonian custom
          (F. Liebrecht, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          384. In the passage of Dio Chrysostom ἐκρέμασαν should strictly
          mean <span class="tei tei-q">“hanged,”</span> but the verb was
          applied by the Greeks to the Roman punishment of crucifixion
          (Plutarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Caesar</span></span>, 2). It may have been
          extended to include impalement, which was often inflicted by the
          Assyrians, as we may see by the representations of it on the
          Assyrian monuments in the British Museum. See also R. F. Harper,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Assyrian
          and Babylonian Literature</span></span>, p. 41, with the plate
          facing p. 54. The proper word for impalement in Greek is
          ἀνασκολοπίζειν (Herodotus, iv. 202). Hanging was also an Oriental
          as well as Roman mode of punishment. The Hebrew word for it (חלה)
          seems unambiguous. See Esther, v. 14, vii. 9 <span class=

          months of the Syro-Macedonian calendar (that is, the ascertainment
          of their astronomical dates in the solar year) is a matter of some
          uncertainty, the dates appearing to have varied considerably in
          different places. The month Lous in particular is variously said to
          have corresponded in different places to July, August, September,
          and October. Until we have ascertained beyond the reach of doubt
          when Lous fell at Babylon in the time of Berosus, it would be
          premature to allow much weight to the seeming discrepancy in the
          dates of Zagmuk and the Sacaea. On the whole difficult question of
          the identification or dating of the months of the Syro-Macedonian

          at Rome that the destined victims were allowed to fight each other,

          follows (3rd February 1902):—<span class="tei tei-q">“Undoubtedly
          the Eastern, through his belief in Fate, has comparatively little
          fear of death. I have sometimes seen the Chinese in great fear;
          but, on the other hand, I have saved at least a hundred lives of
          people who had swallowed opium out of spite against some one else,
          the idea being, first, the trouble given by minions of the law to
          the survivor; second, that the dead would gain a vantage ground by
          becoming a ghost, and thus able to plague his enemy in the flesh.
          Probably blind anger has more to do with it than either of these
          causes. But the particular mode would not ordinarily occur to a
          Western. I am bound to say that in many cases the patient was ready
          enough to take my medicines, but mostly it was the friends who were
          most eager, and exceedingly rarely did I receive thanks from the
          rescued.”</span></dd>

          superstition requires a person to stand on one foot. At Toku-toku,
          in Fiji, the grave-digger who turns the first sod has to stand on
          one leg, leaning on his digging-stick (Rev. Lorimer Fison, in a
          letter to the author, dated August 26, 1898). Among the Angoni of
          British Central Africa, when the corpse of a chief is being burned,
          his heir stands beside the blazing pyre on one leg with his shield
          in his hand; and three days later he again stands on one leg before
          the assembled people when they proclaim him chief. See R.

          pestilence which was then desolating Leinster. They were sacrificed
          in batches of seven a day for a week, the abbot himself perishing

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The old Scholiast on Apollonius
          Rhodius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Argon.</span></span> ii. 653) tells us that
          down to his time it was customary for one of the descendants of
          Athamas to enter the town-hall and sacrifice to Laphystian Zeus. K.
          O. Müller sees in this custom a mitigation of the ancient
          rule—instead of being themselves sacrificed, the scions of royalty
          were now permitted to offer sacrifice (<span class=

          have been so. The obligation to serve as victims in certain
          circumstances lay only on the eldest male of each generation in the
          direct line; the sacrificers may have been younger brothers or more
          remote relations of the destined victims. It may be observed that
          in a dynasty of which the eldest males were regularly sacrificed,
          the kings, if they were not themselves the victims, must always
          have been younger sons.</dd>

          regarding the ram which saved Phrixus as a mythical expression for
          the substitution of a ram for a human victim. He points out that a
          ram was the proper victim to sacrifice to Trophonius (Pausanias,
          ix. 39. 6), whose very ancient worship was practised at Lebadea not
          far from Orchomenus. The principle of vicarious sacrifices was
          familiar enough to the Greeks, as K. O. Müller does not fail to
          indicate. At Potniae, near Thebes, goats were substituted as
          victims instead of boys in the sacrifices offered to Dionysus
          (Pausanias, ix. 8. 2). Once when an oracle commanded that a girl
          should be sacrificed to Munychian Artemis in order to stay a plague
          or famine, a goat dressed up as a girl was sacrificed instead
          (Eustathius on Homer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Ἔμβαρος). At Salamis in Cyprus a man was annually sacrificed to
          Aphrodite and afterwards to Diomede, but in later times an ox was
          substituted (Porphyry, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De abstinentia</span></span>, ii. 54). At
          Laodicea in Syria a deer took the place of a maiden as the victim
          yearly offered to Athena (Porphyry, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> ii. 56). Since human sacrifices have been
          forbidden by the Dutch Government in Borneo, the Barito and other
          Dyak tribes of that island have kept cattle for the sole purpose of
          sacrificing them instead of human beings at the close of mourning
          and at other religious ceremonies. See A. W. Nieuwenhuis,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Exodus xi.-xiii. 16; Numbers iii. 13,
          viii. 17. While many points in this strange story remain obscure,
          the reason which moved the Israelites of old to splash the blood of
          lambs on the doorposts of their houses at the Passover may perhaps
          have been not very different from that which induces the Sea Dyaks
          of Borneo to do much the same thing at the present day.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“When there is any great epidemic in the
          country—when cholera or smallpox is killing its hundreds on all
          sides—one often notices little offerings of food hung on the walls
          and from the ceiling, animals killed in sacrifice, and blood
          splashed on the posts of the houses. When one asks why all this is
          done, they say they do it in the hope that when the evil spirit,
          who is thirsting for human lives, comes along and sees the
          offerings they have made and the animals killed in sacrifice, he
          will be satisfied with these things, and not take the lives of any
          of the people living in the Dyak village house”</span> (E. H.

          "font-style: italic">Seventeen Years among the Sea Dyaks of
          Borneo</span></span>, London, 1911, p. 201). Similarly in Western
          Africa, when a pestilence or an attack of enemies is expected, it
          is customary to sacrifice sheep and goats and smear their blood on
          the gateways of the village (Miss Mary H. Kingsley, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Travels in West
          Africa</span></span>, p. 454, compare p. 45). In Peru, when an
          Indian hut is cleansed and whitewashed, the blood of a llama is
          always sprinkled on the doorway and internal walls in order to keep
          out the evil spirit (Col. Church, cited by E. J. Payne,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History

          of note that the three swarms which afterwards developed into the
          Piceni, the Samnites, and the Hirpini were said to have been guided
          by a woodpecker, a bull, and a wolf respectively, of which the
          woodpecker (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hirpus</span></span>) gave their names to the
          Piceni and the Hirpini. The tradition may perhaps preserve a trace
          of totemism, but in the absence of clearer evidence it would be
          rash to assume that it does so. The woodpecker was sacred among the
          Latins, and a woodpecker as well as a wolf is said to have fed the
          twins Romulus and Remus (Plutarch, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quaest.

          Does this legend point to the existence of a wolf-clan and a
          woodpecker-clan at Rome? There was perhaps a similar conjunction of
          wolf and woodpecker at Soracte, for the woodpecker is spoken of as
          the bird of Feronia (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

          predecessor's soul, but his divinity or holiness, which is looked

          viii. (1908) pp. 22-24. There is a good deal to be said in favour
          of Dr. Westermarck's theory, which is supported in particular by
          the sanctity attributed to the regalia. But on the whole I see no
          sufficient reason to abandon the view adopted in the text, and I am
          confirmed in it by the Shilluk evidence, which was unknown to Dr.
          Westermarck when he propounded his theory.</dd>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the May,”</span> which is a young
          birch-tree wreathed and decorated. Another name for this
          Whitsuntide masker, both in Lower and Upper Bavaria, is the
          Water-bird. Sometimes he carries a straw effigy of a monstrous bird
          with a long neck and a wooden beak, which is thrown into the water
          instead of the bearer. The wooden beak is afterwards nailed to the
          ridge of a barn, which it is supposed to protect against lightning
          and fire for a whole year, till the next <span class=

          mummer, called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          leafy arbour, which is mounted on a cart and drawn about the
          village by four or six lads. They collect gifts at the houses and
          finally throw the cart and the <span class=

          "font-style: italic">Rauchfiess</span></span> into a shallow pool
          outside the village. This is called <span class=

          "font-style: italic">Rauchfiess</span></span>.”</span> The custom
          used to be associated with the driving out of the cattle at
          Whitsuntide to pasture on the dewy grass, which was thought to make
          the cows yield plenty of milk. The herdsman who was the last to
          drive out his beasts on the morning of the day became the

          which are tied together. They arrange themselves so that those born
          during the summer stand close to the water, and those born in the
          winter stand inland; and then they pull at the rope to see whether
          summer or winter is the stronger. If winter should win, there will
          be plenty of food; if summer should win, there will be a bad
          winter.”</span> See Fr. Boas, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Eskimo

          were two statues in front of the temple of Hephaestus (Ptah), of
          which the more northern was popularly called Summer and the more
          southern Winter. The people worshipped the image of Summer and
          execrated the image of Winter. It has been suggested that the two
          statues represented Osiris and Typhon, the good and the bad god.

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
